## Documentation Standards

### Documentation as Source of Truth

Documentation is **not optional**. It is the foundation of the project.

**Rules**:

1. **Every significant decision must be documented** — gameplay, UI, UX, architecture, features, balancing, technical
2. **Update documentation before considering tasks complete** — code and docs ship together
3. **Never allow documentation to become outdated** — discrepancies must be resolved immediately
4. **If a change affects multiple documents, update all affected documents**
5. **Keep documentation synchronized with implementation** throughout the entire development lifecycle
6. **Use Markdown best practices** and maintain consistent formatting

### Workspace Agent Guidance

The workspace includes permanent Codex skills that guide agent work:

- `.agents/skills/scan-chan-core-rules/` defines project-wide source-of-truth and product guardrails.
- `.agents/skills/scan-chan-development-workflow/` defines the mandatory implementation workflow before, during, and after code changes.
- `.agents/skills/scan-chan-design-director/` defines the mandatory creative review workflow for visual, UX, motion, mascot, accessibility, emotional, and brand decisions.

These skills do not replace project documentation. If a skill and `docs/` ever disagree, the discrepancy must be resolved before implementation continues.

### When to Create New Documents

Create a new document when:

- A new system is introduced that doesn't fit existing documents
- A document becomes too large (> 1000 lines)
- A topic requires dedicated focus (e.g., Sound Design Document, Marketing Plan)

New documents should:

- Be placed in the `/docs` folder
- Follow the same Markdown standards
- Be linked from this README
- Include a Table of Contents

### Markdown Standards

- Use `#` for document title (only once per document)
- Use `##` for major sections
- Use `###` for subsections
- Use tables for structured data
- Use bullet lists for collections of items
- Use code blocks for technical specifications
- Include horizontal rules (`---`) between major sections
- End documents with `**Document End**`

## Quick Reference

### Core Design Principles

1. **The Pet Comes First** — Every decision serves the pet
2. **Scanning = Feeding = Love** — Physical act mirrors emotional act
3. **Absence Has Weight** — Pet misses player warmly, never guilt-trips
4. **Growth is Visible and Meaningful** — Time invested shows
5. **Cozy, Never Stressful** — No fail states, comfort gaming
6. **The Physical World Matters** — Real products, real connection

### Emotional Pillars

Comfort · Warmth · Companionship · Tenderness · Delight · Peace · Nostalgia · Pride

*Every feature must serve at least one pillar. See [PLAYER_EXPERIENCE_DOCUMENT.md](./PLAYER_EXPERIENCE_DOCUMENT.md).*

### The Five Pet Stats

| Stat | Decay Rate | Recovery |
|------|------------|----------|
| Hunger | -5/hour | +15-30 per scan |
| Mood | -3/hour | +10 new products, +5 favorites |
| Energy | -2/hour (awake) | +10/hour (sleeping) |
| Affection | -1/day | +5 per scan, min 25 |
| Curiosity | -4/hour | +20 new barcodes |

### Evolution Stages

| Stage | Level Range | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Kitten | 1-5 | ~1-2 weeks |
| Young Cat | 6-15 | ~1-2 months |
| Adult Cat | 16-35 | ~3-6 months |
| Wise Cat | 36-60 | ~6-12 months |
| Legendary Cat | 61-100 | 1-2+ years |

### Mode Separation
