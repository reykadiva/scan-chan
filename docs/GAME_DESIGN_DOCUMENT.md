## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 The Vision

**Scan Chan is not a barcode app with gamification.**

**Scan Chan is a cozy virtual pet game where barcode scanning is how you feed your cat.**

Players adopt a pixel-art companion named Scan Chan—a small, curious cat who depends on them for survival. Every scan of a real-world product becomes an act of care: feeding, playing with, or comforting their pet. The barcode is simply the bridge between the physical world and the emotional bond between player and pet.

### 1.2 The Core Fantasy

You are the caretaker of a unique digital companion. Scan Chan recognizes the foods you share with them, remembers your habits, grows alongside you, and expresses genuine personality through reactions to your care choices.

### 1.3 Target Audience

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Primary** | Casual mobile players seeking low-commitment emotional connection |
| **Secondary** | Cozy game enthusiasts (Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Neko Atsume players) |
| **Tertiary** | Barcode scanning utility users who appreciate gamification |

### 1.4 Platform Philosophy

Mobile-first web experience. No app store friction. Shareable via link. Persistent across devices through local storage.

---

## 2. Core Design Principles

### Principle 1: The Pet Comes First

Every design decision begins with: *"Does this serve the pet?"*

If a feature doesn't strengthen the player-pet bond, it doesn't belong in Scan Chan.

### Principle 2: Scanning = Feeding = Love

A barcode scan is never "just data collection." It is the player choosing to nourish their companion. The physical act of scanning mirrors the emotional act of feeding.

### Principle 3: Absence Has Weight

Scan Chan should miss the player when they're gone. Not punitively—never guilt-tripping—but with genuine warmth upon return. The cat naps when you're away. They perk up when you come back.

### Principle 4: Growth is Visible and Meaningful

Every evolution stage, every new behavior, every unlocked memory must feel earned. Time invested should translate directly into visible change.

### Principle 5: Cozy, Never Stressful

Scan Chan is a safe space. There are no fail states. The cat never dies. The worst outcome is a grumpy pet who needs extra attention. This is comfort gaming.

### Principle 6: The Physical World Matters

Scan Chan celebrates the real world. Scanning a snack you're actually eating creates a bridge between your life and your pet's life. The game acknowledges reality.

---

## 3. Visual Philosophy

### 3.1 Art Direction

**Style**: Cozy Pixel Realism — 16-bit pixel art with modern lighting and particle effects. Think Celeste meets Neko Atsume.

**Color Palette**:

| Element | Colors |
|---------|--------|
| **Base** | Warm creams, soft browns, muted pastels |
| **Accents** | Vibrant pixel-perfect highlights (cyan for energy, pink for affection, yellow for happiness) |
| **Mood Lighting** | Dynamic backgrounds that shift with Scan Chan's emotional state |

**Animation Philosophy**:

- Idle animations breathe life into stillness
- Reactive animations respond to player interaction
- Evolution animations are celebratory and memorable
- Particle effects (hearts, sparkles, zzz's) communicate emotion instantly

### 3.2 UI Philosophy

**Invisible Interface**: The UI never competes with the pet. Stats are ambient, not demanding. Buttons are soft, rounded, inviting. Everything feels like a storybook, not a spreadsheet.

### 3.3 Environmental Storytelling

The pet's room tells their history. Unlockable decorations, seasonal items, and memory artifacts accumulate over time. A veteran player's room looks fundamentally different from a new player's room.

---

## 4. Emotional Goals

### 4.1 Intended Emotions

| Moment | Intended Emotion |
|--------|------------------|
| First meeting | Curiosity, tenderness |
| First feeding | Delight, surprise |
| Return after absence | Warmth, being missed |
| Evolution | Pride, accomplishment |
| Unlocking memory | Nostalgia, connection |
| Pet sleeping peacefully | Calm, contentment |
| Pet playing with toy | Joy, amusement |
| Discovering favorite food | Surprise, personalization |

### 4.2 Emotions to Avoid

Players should **never** feel:

- **Guilt** for not playing enough
- **Anxiety** about missing optimal strategies
- **Frustration** with opaque systems
- **Loneliness** without the pet
- **Pressure** to scan constantly

### 4.3 The Emotional Contract

> **Scan Chan promises**: *"I will be here when you need me. I will remember you. I will grow with you."*
>
> **The player promises**: *"I will care for you when I can."*

This contract is asymmetrical by design. The pet gives more than it takes.

---

## 5. The Pet System

### 5.1 Who is Scan Chan?

Scan Chan is not a generic pet. Scan Chan is **your** Scan Chan—a unique companion with:

- **A name** (player-chosen at adoption)
- **A personality** (emergent from care patterns)
- **Memories** (recorded scan history as emotional moments)
- **Preferences** (favorite foods discovered over time)
- **Moods** (dynamic emotional states)
- **A physical form** (evolving through stages)

### 5.2 Personality System

Scan Chan's personality emerges from how the player cares for them:

| Care Pattern | Personality Trait | Visible Behavior |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Frequent feeding | Foodie | Excited animations near meal times |
| Varied diet | Adventurous | Curious about new scan types |
| Consistent schedule | Routine-loving | Predictable daily behaviors |
| Occasional play | Independent | Content alone, greets warmly |
| Constant attention | Social | Follows cursor, meows often |
| Night scans | Nocturnal | Active at night, sleepy by day |

Personality is not binary. Scan Chan exists on a spectrum, showing dominant traits while retaining complexity.

Direct interactions also shape personality. Petting and greeting strengthen social behavior, observing supports independence, comforting reinforces gentleness, praise supports routine-loving behavior, and play supports adventurous behavior. These signals should remain gentle and cumulative rather than forcing abrupt personality changes.

Feeding shapes personality as well. Frequent meals, snacks, and treats strengthen Foodie tendencies; fresh or unknown food strengthens Adventurous tendencies; familiar drinks can support routine-loving behavior. Favorite foods may amplify the response, but the reaction should feel like preference rather than optimization.

### 5.3 Memory System

Every scan becomes a memory:

- **First Feed**: The first product ever scanned
- **Favorites**: Top 3 most-scanned product categories
- **Milestones**: 10th scan, 50th scan, 100th scan
- **Special Moments**: Scans during holidays, birthdays, streaks
- **Rare Finds**: Unusual or unique products

Memories are visualized as a scrapbook or photo album the player can browse. Each memory includes the date, the product, and Scan Chan's reaction.

Meaningful direct interactions can also create memories. Greet, comfort, praise, and play moments may become `Special Moments` when they represent a warm emotional beat. Routine petting and observation should usually affect state without creating memory clutter.

Meaningful feeding events create memories too. The first feeding creates `First Feed`, favorite foods may create `Favorites`, and new or unusual foods may create `Rare Finds`. Ordinary repeated feeding should update history without cluttering the scrapbook.

## 6. Pet Stats & Needs

### 6.1 Hunger

**What it represents**: How recently and well Scan Chan has been fed.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Range** | 0-100 |
| **Decay rate** | -5 per hour (slower when sleeping) |

**Effects by level**:

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 80-100 | Happy, energetic, playful animations |
| 50-79 | Content, normal behavior |
| 25-49 | Slightly grumpy, slower animations |
| 0-24 | Sad, curled up, occasional meows |

**Recovery**: +15-30 per scan (varies by product category)

**Note**: Hunger never causes damage. At 0, Scan Chan simply naps until fed.

**Implementation Note**: Passive absence decay never reduces hunger to 0. Zero remains a valid direct gameplay boundary for future feature logic, but time away from the app must not create a punishment state.

### 6.2 Mood

**What it represents**: Emotional wellbeing, affected by variety and attention.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Range** | 0-100 |
| **Decay rate** | -3 per hour (slower with toys in room) |

**Effects by level**:

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 80-100 | Joyful, playful, purring animations |
| 50-79 | Content, neutral expressions |
| 25-49 | Bored, repetitive idle animations |
| 0-24 | Sad, withdrawn, needs comfort |

**Recovery**:

- +10 for scanning new products
- +5 for scanning favorite categories
- +15 for completing daily missions
- +20 for playing mini-games (future feature)

**Implementation Note**: Passive absence decay never reduces mood to 0. The player should never return to a guilt-inducing neglect state.

### 6.3 Energy

**What it represents**: Physical vitality, tied to activity and rest.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Range** | 0-100 |
| **Decay rate** | -2 per hour when awake, +10 per hour when sleeping |

**Effects by level**:

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 80-100 | Hyper, zoomies animations |
| 50-79 | Active, normal movement |
| 25-49 | Tired, slow movement, yawning |
| 0-24 | Exhausted, sleeping (forced nap) |

**Recovery**: Natural recovery during sleep cycles. Player cannot force awake.

**Design Note**: Energy enforces healthy play patterns. If player scans at 3am repeatedly, Scan Chan adapts to nocturnal schedule.

**Implementation Note**: Passive absence decay never reduces energy to 0. Low energy may place Scan Chan into sleep or rest, but absence should read as calm rest rather than punishment.

### 6.4 Affection

**What it represents**: Bond strength between player and pet.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Range** | 0-100 |
| **Decay rate** | -1 per day (very slow—affection is persistent) |

**Effects by level**:

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 80-100 | Deep bond, follows player, special animations |
| 50-79 | Friendly, greets player, normal interactions |
| 25-49 | Shy, takes time to warm up |
| 0-24 | Distant, but never hostile |

**Recovery**:

- +5 per scan
- +10 per day of active play
- +25 for evolution milestones
- +15 for returning after 24+ hour absence

**Critical Design**: Affection never drops below 25 for established players. The bond, once formed, is permanent.

### 6.5 Curiosity

**What it represents**: Interest in new experiences, fueled by variety.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Range** | 0-100 |
| **Decay rate** | -4 per hour |

**Effects by level**:

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 80-100 | Exploring room, investigating objects |
| 50-79 | Alert, watching player |
| 25-49 | Disinterested, idle |
| 0-24 | Bored, sleeping |

**Implementation Note**: Passive absence decay never reduces curiosity to 0. Curiosity can soften over time, but the pet must remain emotionally available when the player returns.

**Recovery**:

- +20 for scanning new barcodes (never scanned before)
- +10 for scanning different categories than yesterday
- +5 for completing "try something new" missions

### 6.6 Stat Interactions

Stats influence each other:

| Combination | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| High Hunger + Low Mood | Grumpy but active |
| Low Hunger + High Mood | Playful despite hunger |
| Low Energy (any level) | Overrides all → Forced sleep |
| High Affection + Low Mood | Pet seeks comfort from player |
| High Curiosity + High Energy | Zoomies and exploration |

### 6.7 Visual Communication

Stats are never shown as raw numbers in normal gameplay. Instead:

| Stat | Visual Cue |
|------|------------|
| **Hunger** | Stomach rumble sounds, looking at food bowl |
| **Mood** | Facial expressions, tail position, ear position |
| **Energy** | Yawning, stretching, eye openness |
| **Affection** | Proximity to camera, purring volume |
| **Curiosity** | Ear perkiness, pupil dilation, movement speed |

Advanced players can enable "Stat View" for optimization, but it's hidden by default.

## 8. The Gameplay Loop

### 8.0 Direct Pet Interactions

Sprint 2.2 defines the foundation for direct pet interactions before any UI is built:

| Interaction | Purpose | Primary Influence |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `pet` | A small affectionate touch | Affection, Mood |
| `greet` | A warm hello when the player returns | Affection, Mood, Greeting lifecycle |
| `observe` | Quietly watching the pet live | Curiosity |
| `comfort` | Reassuring the pet during low mood moments | Mood, Affection |
| `praise` | Positive reinforcement after a good moment | Mood, Affection, Curiosity |
| `play` | Foundation-only active engagement | Mood, Curiosity, Energy cost |

Interactions use short cooldowns to prevent spam, not to pressure the player. Cooldowns must never become timers, chores, penalties, streak pressure, or loss mechanics. Visual feedback, animation, sound, and Home Hub interaction surfaces belong to later sprints.

Sprint 2.6 defines the Home Hub ViewModel foundation before any Home Hub UI is built. It derives greeting state, pet summary, daily summary, gentle next-action hints, loading state, and empty state from existing store/domain state only. These hints must keep Scan Chan as the emotional focus, must never become chores or pressure mechanics, and must not duplicate pet, feeding, scanner, product, inventory, settings, or profile business rules.

### 8.1 Core Loop (Single Session)

---

## 9. Why Barcode Scanning Matters

### 9.1 The Problem with Traditional Pet Games

Most virtual pet games use abstract interactions:

- Press button → feed generic food
- Press button → play generic game
- Press button → clean generic mess

These interactions feel hollow because they lack connection to reality.

### 9.2 The Scan Chan Solution

Barcode scanning bridges the physical and digital:

1. **You're eating a real snack** → You scan it → Scan Chan eats what you eat
2. **You're buying groceries** → You scan items → Scan Chan experiences your shopping trip
3. **You discover a new product** → You scan it → Scan Chan tries something new with you

### 9.3 The Emotional Bridge

| Situation | Scan Chan's Response |
|-----------|---------------------|
| You scan a coffee at 8am | Scan Chan perks up with you |
| You scan a midnight snack | Scan Chan gets a late-night treat |
| You scan the same product every day | Scan Chan develops a favorite |
| You scan something unusual | Scan Chan reacts with surprise |

### 9.4 The Collection Fantasy

Every product you've ever scanned becomes part of Scan Chan's story. Years from now, you can browse their memory book and see:

- "This was the first thing you ever fed me"
- "You scanned this 47 times—it's my favorite!"
- "Remember when you tried this weird flavor?"

The barcode database becomes a **diary of your life together**.

### 9.4.1 Feeding Foundation

Before scanner integration, feeding is modeled as a pure pet-domain event. A food item has a category and nutrition profile. Feeding affects all five pet stats:

- Hunger increases from the food's fullness value.
- Mood increases from enjoyment.
- Energy changes based on the food category.
- Affection increases because feeding is care.
- Curiosity increases when the food is novel, fresh, or unusual.

The pet should not be overfed. If Scan Chan is already full, feeding is rejected without penalty. Invalid food is rejected without changing state. These rules protect the cozy fantasy: feeding is care, not a spam action or optimization exploit.

### 9.4.2 Product To Food Translation

Product metadata must become food before it can affect Scan Chan. The scanner only finds a barcode and product lookup only returns product metadata. Translation decides whether that metadata is known, unknown, or unsupported.

- Known food-like products become a matching food category.
- Unknown products become a gentle mystery food so discovery still feels warm.
- Unsupported products do not become feedable care actions.
- Product quality is scored from available metadata so future balancing can prefer better lookup results.

The feeding engine must never need barcode or product database knowledge. It should receive a `FoodModel` only.

### 9.4.3 Scanner Pipeline Foundation

The scanner pipeline exists to preserve the emotional bridge without letting scanner code own gameplay rules:

```
Scan Request -> Barcode Value -> Product Lookup -> Product Translation -> FoodModel -> Feeding Engine -> Pet Engine
```

Camera adapters may later provide barcode values from web or native mobile scanners. They must not decide food stats, feeding outcomes, pet state, memories, rewards, missions, achievements, or evolution. Mobile camera concerns such as blurry previews, autofocus, scan latency, lifecycle stability, Safari compatibility, and Android CameraX compatibility belong to adapter implementation only.

### 9.5 Comparison

| Traditional Pet Game | Scan Chan |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Abstract feeding | Real-world connection |
| Generic food items | Your actual groceries |
| No personalization | Your scan history is unique |
| Disposable experience | Permanent memory archive |
| Isolated gameplay | Integrated with daily life |

---

## 10. XP & Progression Design

### 10.1 XP Philosophy

XP represents **time invested in the relationship**, not grinding efficiency. The curve is designed so:

- **Week 1**: Rapid early progression (dopamine, learning)
- **Month 1**: Steady progression (habit formation)
- **Month 3**: Slower but meaningful (commitment)
- **Month 6+**: Long-term goals (mastery)

### 10.2 XP Sources

| Action | Base XP | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Scan any product | +10 XP | Repeatable, but diminishing returns |
| Scan NEW product | +25 XP | First-time bonus |
| Complete daily mission | +50 XP | 3 missions per day |
| Complete weekly mission | +150 XP | 1 mission per week |
| Maintain streak | +5 XP/day | Consecutive day bonus |
| Evolution milestone | +500 XP | One-time bonus |
| Return after absence | +20 XP | "Welcome back" bonus |

### 10.3 The Level Curve

**Formula**: `XP to next level = (level × 150) + 100`

| Level | Total XP | Real-World Equivalent |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| 1-5 | 0-1,250 | First week |
| 10 | 5,000 | ~2 weeks |
| 20 | 20,000 | ~1 month |
| 35 | 75,000 | ~3 months |
| 50 | 175,000 | ~6 months |
| 75 | 450,000 | ~1 year |
| 100 | 900,000 | ~2 years |

### 10.4 Daily XP Caps

|---------------|---------------|
| First 5 scans | 100% XP |

This ensures casual players aren't outpaced by obsessive players.

### 10.5 Bonus XP Events

|-------|-------|
| Weekend Bonus | +10% XP Saturday/Sunday |
| Holiday Events | +25% XP during special dates |

## 13. Collection Philosophy

### 13.1 The Collection Fantasy

Scan Chan isn't just collecting barcodes. Scan Chan is collecting **experiences**.

Every product represents:

- A moment in time
- A real-world object
- A shared experience between player and pet
- A memory worth preserving

### 13.2 Collection Categories

#### Product Collection

Every unique product scanned, organized by:

- Category (Snacks, Drinks, Household, etc.)
- Brand
- First scan date
- Scan count (how often you buy it)

#### Memory Collection

Curated moments:

- Firsts (first scan, first evolution, first streak)
- Favorites (most-scanned products)
- Milestones (level-ups, achievements)
- Special (holidays, events, rare finds)

#### Decoration Collection

Room items earned through:

- Level progression
- Achievement unlocks
- Seasonal events
- Special missions

### 13.3 Collection UI Philosophy

The collection is not a spreadsheet. It's a:

- **Scrapbook** for memories
- **Pantry** for products
- **Gallery** for decorations

Each view is visual, tactile, and satisfying to browse.

## 14. Long-Term Progression

### 14.1 The 2-Year Journey

Scan Chan is designed for players who return for years, not days.

- **Genuine curiosity** about future evolutions
- **Community sharing** of unique pets

Never through:

- Fear of missing out
- Punitive absence mechanics
- Pay-to-win shortcuts
- Artificial time gates

---

## 15. Player Retention Strategy

### 15.1 The Hook Model (Ethical Version)

#### Trigger: Internal Motivation

- "I wonder what Scan Chan is doing?"
- "I should feed them while I eat"
- "Let me check my streak"

#### Action: Low-Friction Interaction

- Open app (instant load)
- Scan one product (10 seconds)
- See pet reaction (immediate feedback)

#### Variable Reward: Emotional Payoff

- Pet's unique reaction to this product
- Memory created
- XP gained
- Mission progress

#### Investment: Building the Relationship

- Time invested increases affection
- Memories accumulate
- Room customizes
- Pet evolves

### 15.2 Retention Tactics

| Timeline | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| Day 1-3 | Rapid feedback, first evolution tease, easy missions |
| Day 4-7 | Streak building, personality emergence, room unlock |
| Week 2-4 | First evolution, collection growth, achievement hunting |
| Month 2-3 | Deep customization, social sharing, long-term goals |
| Month 4-6 | Nostalgia features, memory reviews, veteran status |
| Month 7+ | Endgame content, legendary progression, community events |

### 15.3 The "Welcome Back" Philosophy

When players return after absence:

| Absence Duration | Response |
|------------------|----------|
| **Short (1-3 days)** | Scan Chan naps, wakes up happy. "I missed you!" animation. Quick catch-up missions. |
| **Medium (4-7 days)** | Scan Chan looks slightly sad, then excited. "Where did you go?" memory entry. Bonus XP for return. |
| **Long (8+ days)** | Scan Chan is sleeping, wakes slowly. "I knew you'd come back" animation. No penalty, just warmth. "Welcome Home" achievement. |

**Critical**: Never shame the player. Never show "your pet is sad because you left." Always positive return.

## 16. Mode Separation: Guest vs Arashu

### 16.1 The Philosophy

Guest Mode and Arashu Mode are **completely separate games** that share a codebase.

They have:

- Different databases
- Different progression
- Different communities
- Different futures

### 16.2 Guest Mode: The Public Experience

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Identity** | The default Scan Chan experience |
| **Database** | Public, shared by all guest players |
| **Features** | Standard pet care, public product database, global statistics, community features (future), standard achievements |
| **Progression** | Independent per device (local storage) |
| **Social** | Players can share pet screenshots, compare collections |
| **Product Pool** | Crowdsourced from all guest players |

### 16.3 Arashu Mode: The Private Experience

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Identity** | A bespoke, intimate version for one special player |
| **Database** | Completely separate, private instance |
| **Features** | Everything in Guest Mode, plus: exclusive decorations, custom pet variants, personal product database, private statistics, unique achievements, developer messages (hidden notes from dev) |
| **Progression** | Server-synced, persistent across devices |
| **Social** | None. Completely private. |
| **Product Pool** | Curated, personal, may include "surprise" items placed by developer |

### 16.4 Why This Separation Matters

1. **Privacy**: Arashu's data is never mixed with public data
2. **Exclusivity**: Arashu Mode feels special and personal
3. **Flexibility**: Developer can experiment with Arashu without affecting public
4. **Emotional**: Arashu Mode is a love letter, not a feature

### 16.5 Technical Implications (High-Level)

- Separate database connections
- Separate authentication flows
- Separate product tables
- Separate save states
- Feature flags for Arashu-exclusive content

## 17. Future Expansion Ideas

### 17.1 Near-Term (Post-Launch)

#### Mini-Games

- **Catch the Fish**: Tap game using scanned products as power-ups
- **Memory Match**: Match product cards to earn treats
- **Cat Nap**: Idle game while pet sleeps (earn passive XP)

#### Social Features

- Pet sharing: Send your pet to visit friends' rooms
- Gift system: Send products to friends' pets
- Leaderboards: Most unique products, longest streaks

#### Seasonal Events

- Holiday decorations (Christmas, Halloween, etc.)
- Limited-time missions
- Seasonal pet outfits
- Event-exclusive achievements

### 17.2 Mid-Term (6-12 Months)

#### Multi-Pet System

- Adopt a second pet (different species?)
- Pets interact with each other
- Mentor system: Veteran pet teaches new pet

#### Advanced Customization

- Pet outfits and accessories
- Room themes and layouts
- Custom pet colors/patterns

#### Pet Jobs

- Send pet on "adventures" (idle gameplay)
- Pet brings back souvenirs
- Different jobs for different personalities

### 17.3 Long-Term (1-2 Years)

#### AR Integration

- See Scan Chan in your real room through camera
- Pet "eats" the products you scan in AR
- Share AR photos of pet with real products

#### Cross-Platform Pets

- Export pet to other games/apps
- Pet appears as avatar in partner apps
- Pet NFT (optional, never pay-to-win)

#### Community Features

- Pet playdates (your pet visits others)
- Community challenges (collective goals)
- Pet beauty contests (voted by community)

#### Narrative Expansion

- Pet "dreams" (story sequences)
- Memory cinema (watch your journey)
- Pet diary (AI-generated based on history)

### 17.4 Wildcard Ideas

#### "Pet Swap" Event

Once a year, players can temporarily swap pets with a friend. See how others care for their companions.

#### "Time Capsule"

Bury a memory capsule, unlock it in 1 year. See how much has changed.

#### "Legacy Mode"

When a pet reaches max level, they can "mentor" a new kitten. The original pet remains, but you start a new journey with guidance from your veteran.

## 18. Conclusion

Scan Chan is more than a game. It's a companion. A diary. A bridge between the physical world and emotional connection.

Every scan matters. Every day counts. Every memory is preserved.

The barcode is just the beginning. The relationship is everything.
