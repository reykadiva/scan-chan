## 1. Production Philosophy

### 1.1 Why Production Consistency Matters

The Scan Chan mascot is the emotional and visual identity of the entire product. Every player interaction — scanning, feeding, playing, evolving — is mediated through this one character. If the mascot looks different from one screen to the next, from one animation to the next, or from one evolution stage to the next, the illusion of a living companion is broken.

Production consistency means:

- Every frame was drawn with the same grid, the same palette, the same outline weight
- Every animation uses the same timing philosophy, the same easing, the same anticipation
- Every expression shares the same eye shape language, the same ear movement vocabulary, the same tail behavior
- Every exported asset is named, organized, and optimized the same way

The player should never be able to tell that different frames, different expressions, or different animations were produced at different times or by different artists. The mascot must feel like a single coherent character — always.

### 1.2 Why Every Frame Must Feel Handcrafted

The mascot is pixel art. Pixel art is a medium where every single pixel is a deliberate decision. There is no auto-fill, no gradient tool, no blur filter that can hide a lazy choice. At 48×48, the entire mascot is composed of approximately 2,304 pixels. Each one matters.

A handcrafted frame means:

- No pixel is placed without intention
- No anti-aliasing is used to smooth edges (pixel art is crisp by definition)
- No automated tools generate the sprite without human review
- Every outline pixel is placed to define form, not to approximate it
- Every shading pixel serves the lighting direction and the material it represents

The difference between a mascot that feels alive and a mascot that feels like clip art is the intentionality behind every pixel.

### 1.3 Why Personality Is More Important Than Detail

A mascot with 200 shades of fur and no personality is forgettable. A mascot with 3 shades of fur and unmistakable personality is iconic.

The Scan Chan mascot communicates through:

- **Ear position** (9 distinct positions, each with a clear meaning)
- **Tail movement** (12 distinct states, each communicating emotion)
- **Eye shape** (10+ states, from wide to half-closed to closed)
- **Body posture** (sitting, standing, crouching, stretching, sleeping)
- **Timing** (how fast it blinks, how slowly it stretches, how quickly it reacts)

Detail is the polish. Personality is the soul. The production pipeline prioritizes personality first, then applies detail within the constraints of the pixel grid.

## 2. Pixel Art Specifications

### 2.1 Canvas Size

The mascot is produced on a **48×48 pixel grid**.

This is the base resolution for all mascot sprites. Every sprite — regardless of pose, expression, or evolution stage — is drawn on this grid.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Base canvas** | 48×48 pixels |
| **Canvas type** | Fixed grid, no sub-pixel placement |
| **Pixel shape** | Square (1:1 aspect ratio) |
| **Coordinate origin** | Top-left corner (0,0) |
| **Grid visibility** | Grid lines visible during production, invisible in export |

### 2.2 Recommended Pixel Grid

The 48×48 grid is divided into functional zones for production consistency:

| Zone | Grid Area | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Head** | Rows 2-22, Columns 10-38 | Face, ears, eyes, nose, mouth |
| **Body** | Rows 22-40, Columns 12-36 | Torso, fur markings, chest |
| **Legs/Paws** | Rows 40-46, Columns 14-22 and 26-34 | Front and rear paws |
| **Tail** | Rows 20-44, Columns 0-12 or 36-48 | Tail (extends beyond body on one side) |
| **Margin** | 2px minimum on all sides | Prevents clipping during animation movement |

These zones are guidelines, not rigid boundaries. The tail and ears may extend into margin space during animation.

### 2.3 Export Resolutions

The base 48×48 sprite is exported at multiple resolutions for different display contexts:

| Export Size | Scale Factor | Usage | Rendering |
|------------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| 48×48 | 1× | Source reference only | Never displayed at native 1× |
| 96×96 | 2× | Small companion, secondary views | `image-rendering: pixelated` |
| 144×144 | 3× | Standard hub view (mobile) | `image-rendering: pixelated` |
| 192×192 | 4× | Standard hub view (desktop) | `image-rendering: pixelated` |
| 288×288 | 6× | Large display, special moments | `image-rendering: pixelated` |
| 384×384 | 8× | Marketing, splash screens | `image-rendering: pixelated` |
| 576×576 | 12× | Print, merchandise reference | Nearest-neighbor scaling |

### 2.4 Upscaling Rules

All upscaling from the 48×48 base must follow these rules:

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Integer scale only** | Scale by whole numbers (2×, 3×, 4×, etc.). Never scale by fractional amounts (1.5×, 2.3×). |
| **Nearest-neighbor interpolation** | Always use nearest-neighbor (pixelated) rendering. Never use bilinear, bicubic, or Lanczos. |
| **No anti-aliasing post-scale** | Never apply anti-aliasing or smoothing after upscaling. The pixel edges must remain crisp. |
| **CSS rendering** | Always apply `image-rendering: pixelated` (or `image-rendering: crisp-edges`) in CSS. |
| **Canvas rendering** | When using `<canvas>`, set `ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = false`. |

### 2.5 Scaling Rules

The mascot must be displayed at sizes that preserve readability:

| Display Context | Minimum Display Size | Recommended Display Size |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| App icon / favicon | 32×32px | 48×48px |
| Badge / small icon | 48×48px | 64×64px |
| Game hub companion | 128×128px | 192×192px |
| Full room view | 192×192px | 288×288px |
| Special moments | 256×256px | 384×384px |
| Marketing / splash | 384×384px | 576×576px |

**Never display the mascot below 32×32px.** At sizes below 32px, the expression and detail become unreadable.

### 2.6 Aspect Ratio

The mascot sprite is always **1:1 (square)**. The 48×48 canvas is square, and all exports maintain the square aspect ratio.

Some poses (stretching, lying down) may use the canvas asymmetrically, but the canvas itself remains 48×48.

### 2.7 Allowed Resolutions

Only these canvas sizes are permitted for mascot production:

| Canvas | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| **48×48** | Standard mascot sprite (all poses, expressions, stages) |
| **64×64** | Extended poses that require more space (stretching, zoomies) — rare |
| **96×96** | Evolution sequences, special full-body celebrations — very rare |
| **16×16** | Simplified icon-only version (favicon, badges) — derived from 48×48, not independently drawn |
| **32×32** | Simplified icon version (small UI elements) — derived from 48×48, not independently drawn |

### 2.8 Sprite Density

Sprite density refers to how much of the 48×48 canvas is occupied by the mascot.

| State | Density Target | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Sitting** | ~55-65% of canvas | Compact, centered, tail may extend to edge |
| **Standing** | ~50-60% of canvas | Slightly less compact, legs visible |
| **Lying down** | ~65-75% of canvas | Sprawled, uses more horizontal space |
| **Stretching** | ~60-70% of canvas | Extended, uses vertical and horizontal space |
| **Jumping** | ~40-50% of canvas | Elevated in canvas, space below for shadow |

The mascot should never feel cramped against the canvas edges, nor should it float in excessive empty space.

### 2.9 Readable Sizes

The mascot must be **tested at every intended display size** before approval. A sprite that looks excellent at 192px may be illegible at 48px.

**Mandatory test sizes**:

1. 32×32px — Can you identify it as a cat?
2. 64×64px — Can you read the expression?
3. 128×128px — Can you see the detail?
4. 192×192px — Does it look polished?
5. 384×384px — Does it hold up at large scale?

If any test size fails, the sprite must be revised.

---

## 3. Silhouette Rules

### 3.1 The Silhouette Test

Before any sprite is approved, it must pass the silhouette test:

> **Render the sprite as a solid shape (no internal detail, no color, just the outer boundary). Can a viewer immediately identify it as the Scan Chan mascot?**

If the silhouette is ambiguous — if it could be any generic cat shape, any animal, or any blob — the sprite fails and must be revised.

### 3.2 Head Proportions

The head is the most recognizable part of the mascot.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Head height** | 18-20px (of the 48px canvas) |
| **Head width** | 20-22px |
| **Head shape** | Slightly wider than tall — a soft, rounded rectangle |
| **Head-to-body ratio** | ~40% head, ~60% body (slightly idealized cat proportions) |

**Head rules**:

- The head must never be chibi-proportioned (head > 50% of body)
- The head must never be realistic-proportioned (head < 30% of body)
- The head should feel like "a cat, slightly idealized" — recognizable but appealing

### 3.3 Body Proportions

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Body height** | 14-16px |
| **Body width** | 16-18px |
| **Body shape** | Compact oval / egg shape when sitting |
| **Chest** | Slightly lighter fur color (suggesting a bib/chest marking) |

### 3.4 Ear Proportions

The ears are a key silhouette identifier.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Ear height** | 6-8px (extending above the head) |
| **Ear width** | 4-5px at base |
| **Ear shape** | Slightly rounded tips — NOT pointed (like Siamese), NOT fully round (like Scottish Fold) |
| **Ear spacing** | 10-12px apart (center to center) |
| **Ear interior** | 1-2px of inner ear color (pink/warm tone), visible from the front |

**Ear silhouette rule**: The ear shape must be distinctive. If the ears were removed from the silhouette, the mascot should still be recognizable — but the ears add immediate identification.

### 3.5 Tail Proportions

The tail is the mascot's emotional semaphore. It must be visible in the silhouette.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Tail length** | 14-18px (from base to tip) |
| **Tail width** | 2-3px at base, tapering to 1-2px at tip |
| **Tail shape at rest** | Gentle curve or curl — never straight, never rigid |
| **Tail position** | Extends to one side of the body (left or right, consistent per sprite set) |

**Tail silhouette rule**: The tail must be visible in the silhouette for sitting and standing poses. When sleeping, the tail wraps around the body and becomes part of the overall compact shape.

### 3.6 Leg Proportions

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Front legs** | 4-6px tall, 3-4px wide each |
| **Rear legs** (visible when sitting) | Implied by body shape, not separately drawn in sitting pose |
| **Leg spacing** | 4-6px apart (front legs) |

### 3.7 Paw Proportions

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Paw size** | 3-4px wide, 2-3px tall |
| **Paw shape** | Rounded, slightly wider than the leg |
| **Paw detail** | No individual toes drawn at 48×48 — paws are simple rounded shapes |
| **Paw color** | Same as fur or slightly lighter |

### 3.8 Eye Placement

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Eye position** | Vertical center of the head (rows 10-14 of the head zone) |
| **Eye spacing** | 6-8px apart (center to center) |
| **Eye size** | 3×3 or 4×4 pixels per eye |
| **Eye composition** | Dark base (2-3 tones darker than fur) + 1 highlight pixel (white or warm white) |
| **Highlight position** | Upper-right pixel of each eye (consistent light source) |

### 3.9 Mouth Placement

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Mouth position** | 2-3px below the eyes |
| **Mouth at rest** | NOT drawn — implied by the absence of pixels |
| **Mouth when open** | 2-3px wide, 1-2px tall (small, subtle) |
| **Nose** | 1-2px, centered between eyes, 1px above mouth line |

### 3.10 Balance and Center of Gravity

| Pose | Center of Gravity |
|------|-------------------|
| **Sitting** | Centered horizontally, slightly below vertical center of canvas |
| **Standing** | Centered horizontally, at vertical center |
| **Walking** | Slightly forward (direction of movement) |
| **Sleeping (curled)** | Centered, compact, low in canvas |
| **Jumping** | Elevated in canvas, space below for ground reference |

### 3.11 Readability at Small Sizes

At 32×32px display (the minimum allowed size), the following must remain identifiable:

- The overall cat shape (ears + body + tail)
- That it is facing forward, sideways, or away
- That it is in a general emotional state (alert, relaxed, sleeping)

At 32px, fine details (eye highlights, nose, whiskers) will not be visible. This is acceptable. The silhouette and general posture must carry the identity at this size.

---

## 4. Shape Language

### 4.1 Rounded Forms

Every element of the mascot uses rounded forms. There are no sharp corners anywhere in the mascot's design.

| Element | Shape |
|---------|-------|
| Head | Soft rounded rectangle with generous corner radius |
| Body | Oval / egg shape |
| Ears | Rounded triangles (tips are rounded, not pointed) |
| Eyes | Rounded squares or circles |
| Paws | Rounded rectangles or circles |
| Tail | Smooth curve with rounded tip |
| Nose | Small triangle with rounded corners (1-2px) |

### 4.2 Soft Geometry

The mascot's geometry communicates softness and approachability:

- All transitions between body parts are smooth (no hard edges between head and body)
- The neck area is implied through shading, not outlined
- Limbs connect to the body with soft curves
- The overall form reads as a single continuous shape, not assembled parts

### 4.3 Forbidden Sharp Angles

The following are never permitted in the mascot's design:

- Sharp triangular ear tips
- Angular jaw lines
- Pointed tail tips
- Sharp corners on any body part
- Geometric patterns in fur markings
- Straight-line edges longer than 4px (curves should dominate)

### 4.4 Weight Distribution

The mascot should feel grounded and stable:

- When sitting: weight is distributed evenly, the mascot feels settled
- When standing: weight is slightly forward, suggesting readiness
- When walking: weight shifts naturally with each step
- When sleeping: weight is fully relaxed, the mascot feels heavy and comfortable

### 4.5 Volume Language

The mascot has volume — it is not flat. Volume is communicated through:

- Shading (shadow on one side, highlight on the other)
- Overlap (ears overlap the head edge slightly)
- Perspective hints (front paws slightly larger than rear when standing)
- Tail depth (tail appears to come from behind the body)

### 4.6 Appeal Rules

The mascot's appeal comes from:

- **Proportion**: Slightly idealized cat proportions — not baby, not adult
- **Expression**: Eyes that communicate awareness and warmth
- **Simplicity**: Clean design readable at small sizes
- **Personality**: Distinctive markings, characteristic posture, recognizable tail shape
- **Imperfection**: Slight asymmetry in ear position or tail curl (makes it feel alive, not manufactured)

| **Shadow outline** | Deep Warm Brown | `#201A15` | For darker fur patches |

### 5.10 Seasonal Palette Adjustments

The base palette shifts subtly with seasons. These shifts are applied as color overlays or palette swaps:

| Season | Adjustment | Method |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Spring** | Slightly brighter, +5% saturation | Palette swap |
| **Summer** | Warmer, +5% amber shift | Palette swap |
| **Autumn** | Deeper, richer, +5% brown shift | Palette swap |
| **Winter** | Slightly cooler, lavender hint | Palette swap + overlay |

Seasonal adjustments never change the outline color or eye highlight position.

### 5.11 Rules for Introducing New Colors

When a new color is needed (for accessories, seasonal items, evolution stages):

1. The new color must harmonize with the existing warm palette
2. The new color must not be neon, oversaturated, or cold
3. The new color must have a base, shadow, and highlight variant
4. The new color must be tested against the room environment for contrast
5. The new color must be documented in this section before use
6. No more than 2 new accent colors may be introduced per asset

---

## 6. Pixel Shading Rules

### 6.1 Lighting Direction

The primary light source is always **upper-left** (consistent with the game's room lighting).

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Light angle** | 135° (upper-left, casting shadows to lower-right) |
| **Light temperature** | Warm (amber/golden) |
| **Light intensity** | Soft — never harsh, never creating high-contrast shadows |

### 6.2 Shadow Softness

Shadows on the mascot are soft, not hard:

- Shadow edges are defined by a single pixel transition (base → shadow), not a gradient
- Shadow shapes follow the form of the body part they shade
- Shadow size is proportional to the curvature of the form (more curve = wider shadow)
- Shadows never cover more than 30% of any single color area

### 6.3 Highlight Placement

Highlights communicate the direction and quality of light:

- Highlights appear on the **upper-left edges** of rounded forms
- Highlights are 1-2px wide, following the contour of the form
- Highlights are placed consistently — if the head has a highlight on its upper-left, the body should too
- Highlights use the highlight color variant, never pure white (except eye sparkles)

### 6.4 Ambient Light

The mascot exists in a warm room. Ambient light affects the overall tone:

- The side facing the light source (upper-left) is slightly warmer
- The side away from the light source (lower-right) is slightly cooler (but still warm)
- The underside (belly, bottom of paws) receives less light — shadow is slightly deeper

### 6.5 Bounce Light

When the mascot is on a surface (floor, furniture), bounce light from the surface affects the underside:

- Bounce light is a very subtle warm tone on the bottom edges of the sprite
- Bounce light is optional at 48×48 (it may not be visible at this resolution)
- If used, bounce light is 1px along the bottom edge, using a warm tone lighter than the shadow

### 6.6 Anti-Banding

At 48×48, banding (visible stripes in gradients) is a risk when shading large areas. Prevention rules:

- Never use more than 3 tonal values per color area (base, shadow, highlight)
- Never place shadow and highlight pixels adjacent to each other without a base pixel between them
- For larger flat areas (body, head), use cluster shading (see 6.7) rather than smooth gradients
- Never use dithering patterns on the mascot sprite (dithering is for backgrounds only, and only when appropriate)

### 6.7 Cluster Theory

Shading pixels should be placed in clusters, not scattered:

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| Shadow pixels grouped along a form edge | Shadow pixels randomly scattered |
| Highlight pixels following a contour | Highlight pixels placed arbitrarily |
| 2-4 pixel clusters that read as a shape | Single isolated pixels that read as noise |

**Rule**: Every shading pixel must be adjacent to at least one other pixel of the same tone. Isolated shading pixels look like noise.

### 6.8 Forbidden Shading Techniques

| Technique | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| **Pure black shadows** | Breaks warmth, looks harsh |
| **Pure gray shadows** | Looks cold and industrial |
| **Gradient fills** | Not pixel art — pixel art uses flat tones |
| **Anti-aliased edges** | Pixel art must be crisp |
| **Ambient occlusion** | Too complex for 48×48, looks muddy |
| **Specular highlights** | Too realistic for the style |
| **Dithering on mascot** | Dithering is for backgrounds only |
| **More than 3 tonal values** | Becomes muddy and unreadable at small sizes |
| **Colored light from multiple sources** | The room has one light source — upper-left warm |

## 7. Animation Production Rules

### 7.1 Frame Count Recommendations

| Animation Type | Frame Count | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **Idle breathing** | 2-4 frames | Subtle rise and fall, looping |
| **Blink** | 3-4 frames | Anticipation → close → open |
| **Tail sway** | 4-6 frames | Smooth oscillation, looping |
| **Walking** | 6-8 frames | Full walk cycle |
| **Running** | 6-8 frames | Faster cycle, more bounce |
| **Eating** | 4-6 frames | Approach → bite → chew → pause |
| **Happy bounce** | 4-6 frames | Squash → stretch → settle |
| **Sleeping** | 2-3 frames | Gentle breathing, looping |
| **Yawning** | 5-7 frames | Open → hold → close |
| **Stretching** | 6-8 frames | Extend → hold → return |
| **Evolution** | 12-20 frames | Glow → transform → reveal |
| **Greeting** | 4-6 frames | Perks up → approaches → settles |
| **Surprised** | 3-5 frames | Flinch → freeze → recover |

### 7.2 Animation Timing

| Parameter | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| **Frame rate** | 8-12 FPS for pixel art animations |
| **Frame duration** | 83-125ms per frame at 8-12 FPS |
| **Idle animations** | 8 FPS (slower, relaxed) |
| **Action animations** | 12 FPS (faster, responsive) |
| **Celebration animations** | 10 FPS (balanced) |

### 7.3 Idle Breathing

The most important animation — it runs continuously.

| Frame | Description | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Frame 1 | Neutral position (baseline) | 200ms |
| Frame 2 | Slight rise (1px body shift up) | 200ms |
| Frame 3 | Peak (1px up from baseline) | 200ms |
| Frame 4 | Return to baseline | 200ms |

**Total cycle**: ~800ms, looping. The breathing is barely noticeable — it should feel subconscious, like the mascot is alive without trying to prove it.

### 7.4 Blink

| Frame | Description | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Frame 1 | Eyes open (normal) | Variable (3-5 seconds between blinks) |
| Frame 2 | Eyes half-closed (anticipation) | 50ms |
| Frame 3 | Eyes fully closed | 80ms |
| Frame 4 | Eyes half-open | 50ms |
| Frame 5 | Eyes open (normal) | Resume idle |

**Slow blink variant**: Each frame duration doubled (100ms, 160ms, 100ms). Used for trust/affection moments.

### 7.5 Tail Animation

| State | Frame Count | Speed | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Content sway | 4 | Slow (150ms/frame) | Gentle side-to-side, 2-3px range |
| Happy sway | 6 | Medium (100ms/frame) | Wider range, 4-5px, upright |
| Excited | 4 | Fast (60ms/frame) | Rapid vibration, 2-3px, upright |
| Sleepy wrap | 2 | Very slow (300ms/frame) | Tail curling around body |
| Curious | 3 | Medium (120ms/frame) | Tail extending outward, tip twitching |

### 7.6 Sleeping Animation

| Frame | Description | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Frame 1 | Curled position, baseline | 400ms |
| Frame 2 | Slight body rise (breathing) | 400ms |
| Frame 3 | Return to baseline | 400ms |

Optional: Small "ZZZ" particle every 5-10 seconds.

### 7.7 Walking Animation

| Frame | Description | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Frame 1 | Left front paw forward, right rear forward | 100ms |
| Frame 2 | Body shifts right, tail sways left | 100ms |

| **Gift giving** | High bond + random | Mascot brings small pixel item to cursor |
| **Night patrol** | App opened 2-4 AM | Mascot walks room perimeter |

### 7.25 Animation Principles

Every animation must follow these principles:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Anticipation** | Before any movement, a small preparatory motion in the opposite direction |
| **Follow-through** | Tail and ears continue moving slightly after the body stops |
| **Ease-in / Ease-out** | Movements start slow, accelerate, then decelerate. Never linear. |
| **Squash and stretch** | Jumps and landings use compression and extension for weight |
| **Overlapping action** | Ears, tail, and body move at slightly different times |
| **Appeal** | Every frame should look good — no awkward in-between poses |
| **Timing** | Faster movements = more energy. Slower movements = more weight. |
| **Staging** | The mascot's action should be clear against the background |

Sprint 2.7 introduces animation intent models only. Intent names such as idle, greet, sleep, rest, look-at-player, look-at-food, comfort, and investigate are contracts for future adapters; they are not sprite loading, frame timing, renderer selection, or animation playback. Future adapters may target the pixel sprite renderer, Rive, Live2D, Spine, Pixi, Canvas, or native mobile renderers, and they must translate these intents into production assets while following this guide.

## 9. SVG Production Rules

### 9.1 SVG Philosophy

The Scan Chan mascot is rendered as SVG in the application. The SVG approach provides crisp pixel rendering at any display size, programmatic animation control, and color palette swapping without external image files.

### 9.2 SVG Structure

Every mascot SVG follows this structure:

```xml
<svg viewBox="0 0 48 48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <g id="mascot-base">
    <g id="body">...</g>
    <g id="tail">...</g>
    <g id="head">
      <g id="ears">...</g>
      <g id="face">
        <g id="eyes">...</g>
        <g id="nose">...</g>
        <g id="mouth">...</g>
      </g>
    </g>
    <g id="legs">...</g>
  </g>
  <g id="accessories">...</g>
  <g id="particles">...</g>
</svg>
```

### 9.3 SVG Optimization

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **No inline styles** | Use `fill` and `stroke` attributes directly on elements |
| **Rect elements for pixels** | Each pixel is a `<rect>` with `width="1"` and `height="1"` |
| **Color references** | Use CSS custom properties for palette colors (enables palette swapping) |
| **No transforms on individual pixels** | Transforms apply to groups only |
| **Minimize file size** | Remove metadata, comments, and unnecessary attributes |
| **ViewBox** | Always `viewBox="0 0 48 48"` for standard sprites |

### 9.4 Group Naming

| Group ID | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| `mascot-base` | Root group containing the entire mascot |
| `body` | Torso, chest markings, fur patterns |
| `tail` | All tail pixels (separate group for independent animation) |
| `head` | Head shape, fur markings on head |
| `ears` | Both ears (separate group for ear animation) |
| `ear-left` | Left ear specifically |
| `ear-right` | Right ear specifically |
| `face` | All facial features |
| `eyes` | Both eyes |
| `eye-left` | Left eye specifically |
| `eye-right` | Right eye specifically |
| `nose` | Nose pixels |
| `mouth` | Mouth pixels (when visible) |
| `legs` | All legs and paws |
| `accessories` | Collar, hat, scarf (when equipped) |
| `particles` | Hearts, sparkles, ZZZs (when active) |

### 9.5 Transform Rules

| Transform | Usage | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| `translate` | Body movement, position changes | Primary movement method |
| `rotate` | Ear rotation, head tilt | Applied to group origin point |
| `scale` | Squash and stretch | Applied symmetrically or on one axis |
| `opacity` | Particle fade-in/fade-out | 0 to 1 transitions |

**Never use**: `skew`, `matrix`, or complex compound transforms on pixel groups.

### 9.6 Animation Compatibility

The SVG structure must support CSS and JavaScript animation:

- Every animatable group must have a unique `id`
- Transform origins must be set explicitly (e.g., ear rotation origin at ear base)
- Animation keyframes should use `transform` properties, not pixel manipulation
- CSS transitions preferred for simple state changes
- JavaScript `requestAnimationFrame` for complex multi-frame animations

### 9.7 File Organization

SVG files are organized by purpose:

```
/src/
  /assets/
    /mascot/
      /base/
        sit.svg
        stand.svg
        sleep.svg
        walk/
          walk-01.svg through walk-08.svg
      /expressions/
        happy.svg
        sleepy.svg
        hungry.svg
        ...
      /accessories/
        collar.svg
        scarf-winter.svg
        ...
      /particles/
        heart.svg
        sparkle.svg
        zzz.svg
```

---

## 10. Sprite Sheet Organization

### 10.1 Folder Structure

```
/mascot-assets/
  /source/                     # Production files (Aseprite, Piskel, etc.)
    /base/                     # Base body sprites per evolution stage
      kitten.aseprite
      young-cat.aseprite
      adult-cat.aseprite
      wise-cat.aseprite
      legendary-cat.aseprite
    /expressions/              # Expression overlays per stage
      kitten-happy.aseprite
      kitten-sleepy.aseprite

      /1x/                     # 48×48 native
      /2x/                     # 96×96
      /4x/                     # 192×192
      /8x/                     # 384×384
  /reference/                  # Reference sheets
    expression-sheet.png
    animation-sheet.png
    color-palette.png
    silhouette-test.png
```

### 10.2 Naming Convention

All files follow this pattern:

```
{stage}-{pose}-{expression}-{frame}.{ext}
```

| Component | Values | Example |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **stage** | `kitten`, `young-cat`, `adult-cat`, `wise-cat`, `legendary-cat` | `kitten` |
| **pose** | `sit`, `stand`, `walk`, `sleep`, `stretch`, `eat`, `jump`, `lie` | `sit` |
| **expression** | `neutral`, `happy`, `sleepy`, `hungry`, `excited`, `curious`, `embarrassed`, `sad`, `scared`, `relaxed`, `focused`, `confused`, `proud` | `happy` |
| **frame** | `01` through `99` (zero-padded) | `01` |

**Examples**:
- `kitten-sit-neutral-01.svg`
- `adult-cat-walk-neutral-03.svg`
- `young-cat-sit-happy-01.svg`
- `legendary-cat-sleep-neutral-02.svg`

### 10.3 Animation Folders

Each animation type has its own subfolder:

```
/animations/
  /idle-breathing/
    kitten-sit-neutral-01.svg through 04.svg
  /blink/
    kitten-sit-neutral-blink-01.svg through 04.svg
  /walk/
    kitten-walk-neutral-01.svg through 08.svg
  /eat/
    kitten-eat-neutral-01.svg through 06.svg
  /evolution/
    kitten-evolve-01.svg through 20.svg
```

### 10.4 Frame Numbering

- Frames are numbered sequentially starting from `01`
- Frame `01` is always the first frame of the animation (or the neutral/rest pose)
- Looping animations end with a frame that transitions smoothly back to `01`
- One-shot animations end with a frame that matches the target idle pose

### 10.5 Export Naming

Exported files include the scale factor:

```
kitten-sit-happy-01@2x.png    → 96×96
kitten-sit-happy-01@4x.png    → 192×192
kitten-sit-happy-01.svg       → Vector (resolution-independent)
```

### 10.6 Future Scalability

The naming and folder system must support:

- **New evolution stages**: Add new stage prefix without restructuring
- **New poses**: Add new pose name without conflict
- **New expressions**: Add new expression name without conflict
- **New species**: Add species prefix before stage (e.g., `dog-kitten-sit-neutral-01.svg`)
- **Seasonal variants**: Add season suffix (e.g., `kitten-sit-happy-01-winter.svg`)

### 14.2 How to Use the Production Checklist

1. Before submitting any mascot asset for implementation, review every question above.
2. If any question fails, the asset must be revised.
3. If an asset fails 5 or more questions, it must be fundamentally reworked.
4. The checklist applies to: base sprites, expression variants, animation frames, accessory sprites, exported SVGs, exported PNGs, and any other mascot-related asset.

### 14.3 Escalation

If a production decision conflicts with this guide:

1. Document the conflict
2. Propose a production method that satisfies both the need and this guide
3. If no alternative exists, this guide takes priority
4. The conflict and resolution are logged for future reference
