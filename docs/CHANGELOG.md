### Added

- **Sprint Book v1.0** - Added `docs/SPRINT_BOOK.md` as the definitive production roadmap and mandatory sprint governance document for Scan Chan. It defines Sprint 0 through Sprint 9, sprint philosophy, immutable development rules, sprint dependencies, expected outcomes, sprint-specific boundaries, mandatory Definition of Done, timeline philosophy, and sprint approval checklist. Added the Sprint Book to `docs/README.md` and `AGENTS.md` as a mandatory reference before implementation planning.
- **Scan Chan Design Director workspace skill** - Added a permanent Creative Director skill at `.agents/skills/scan-chan-design-director/` to review and approve visual, UX, animation, motion, pixel art, mascot expression, mascot animation, typography, color, design token, state, scanner, Home Hub, accessibility, emotional, and brand decisions against the authoritative design documents.
- **Scan Chan Development Workflow workspace skill** - Added a permanent workspace Codex skill at `.agents/skills/scan-chan-development-workflow/` defining mandatory AI contributor workflow for planning, documentation reads, component reuse, state management, file organization, naming, animation, design tokens, accessibility, performance, self-review, documentation updates, changelog entries, PR readiness, and feature completion.
- **Scan Chan Core Rules workspace skill** - Added a permanent workspace Codex skill at `.agents/skills/scan-chan-core-rules/` to enforce documentation-first implementation, pet-first product direction, anti-dashboard UI guidance, Guest/Arashu database isolation, maintainable architecture, purposeful animation, and documentation synchronization.

### Changed

- **Sprint 0 foundation cleanup** - Quarantined legacy v1 routes, APIs, components, state, product UI, mascot prototype, and reward utilities under legacy namespaces while preserving current public URLs and app behavior. Added architecture-aligned component category folders, route-group skeleton folders, domain type files, minimal Zustand store boundaries, `public/audio/` asset placement, `.env.example`, and explicit Guest/Arashu Prisma client boundaries to prepare the repository for the Scan Chan v2 foundation rebuild.
- **Sprint 1.1 architecture boundaries** - Added v2 domain boundary folders, empty Zustand store shells, provider boundaries, service interfaces, repository interfaces, asset placeholders, API placeholders, and barrel exports for pet, game, scanner, UI, inventory, profile, settings, and shared domains without implementing gameplay or final UI.
