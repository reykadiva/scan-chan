## 1. Design System Philosophy

### 1.1 Why the Interface Exists

The Scan Chan interface exists for one reason: to create a warm, quiet space where a small companion lives.

Every UI element — every button, every card, every label, every shadow — exists to support that companion. The interface is not the product. The interface is the room. The pet is the product.

If the interface disappears and the player sees only their cat, sitting in a sunlit room, waiting for them — the design system has succeeded.

### 1.2 How the Interface Supports the Pet

The interface supports the pet through five mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Framing** | UI elements form a soft border around the pet's space, like the frame of a painting. They never cross into the painting. |
| **Atmosphere** | Backgrounds, gradients, and lighting create the room the pet lives in. The UI paints the walls, the light, the warmth. |
| **Information** | When the player needs to know something — hunger, level, missions — the UI communicates it ambiently, without data panels. |
| **Action** | When the player wants to do something — scan, feed, navigate — the UI provides soft, rounded tools that feel like touching cushions. |
| **Celebration** | When something special happens — evolution, achievement, milestone — the UI steps forward briefly to honor the moment, then retreats. |

### 1.3 Why the UI Should Disappear

The best interface in a companion game is one the player never thinks about.

When a player opens Scan Chan, they should not think "nice UI." They should think "there you are." The interface is the glass of the window — invisible, clean, allowing the view to be the focus.

Every pixel of UI chrome is a pixel that is not the pet. Every element that competes with the pet for attention is an element that weakens the companion bond.

The UI must be present. It must be functional. It must be beautiful. But it must never be the star.

### 1.4 Core Principles

These ten principles govern every UI decision in Scan Chan. When in doubt, return here.

#### Principle 1: Pet First, Always

The pet is the largest, most detailed, most animated element on every screen. If the pet is not the first thing the eye finds, the layout is wrong.

#### Principle 2: Warmth Is the Default

Every color, every shape, every shadow, every transition must feel warm. The player should feel like they are looking at something bathed in afternoon sunlight. Cool colors exist only as contrast or night mode.

#### Principle 3: Softness Everywhere

No sharp corners. No hard edges. No aggressive geometry. Every element has a radius. Every transition has an ease. Every interaction feels like pressing something soft.

#### Principle 4: Less Is More

One beautiful thing beats ten adequate things. One clear action beats five competing buttons. One warm color beats a rainbow. Restraint is the design system's greatest strength.

#### Principle 5: Consistency Creates Trust

Every button behaves the same way. Every card looks like it belongs to the same family. Every animation uses the same easing. The player never has to learn a new pattern. The system teaches once and repeats forever.

#### Principle 6: Information Is Ambient

Stats, numbers, progress — these exist, but they whisper. They do not shout. The player should understand how their pet feels by looking at the cat, not by reading a dashboard. Numbers are secondary to behavior.

#### Principle 7: Motion Is Life, But Gentle Life

Things breathe, float, settle, and respond. Nothing snaps, jolts, or startles. Every animation feels like watching a cat stretch — slow, organic, peaceful.

#### Principle 8: Every Element Earns Its Place

If a UI element does not serve the pet, the player, or the atmosphere, it does not belong. Decoration without purpose is noise. Every element must justify its presence.

#### Principle 9: Mobile-First Means Touch-First

Every interactive element must feel good to tap. Large targets. Satisfying press animations. Generous spacing. The player's thumb should never strain.

#### Principle 10: The Room Feels Lived-In

Nothing is sterile. Nothing is perfectly aligned. Small imperfections, warm shadows, and organic textures make the space feel real and personal. The UI should feel handcrafted, not manufactured.

### 1.5 Anti-Patterns

These patterns are explicitly banned from Scan Chan. If any of these appear in a design, it must be revised.

#### Banned Pattern 1: Dashboard Layouts

No dense data grids. No sidebar navigation with 10+ items. No multi-column layouts with competing information. No charts or graphs as primary UI elements. Scan Chan is a home, not an office.

#### Banned Pattern 2: SaaS Visual Language

No sharp-edged cards with thin borders. No gray-on-gray text hierarchies. No enterprise color schemes (corporate blue, sterile white). No dropdown-heavy navigation. No admin-panel aesthetics.

#### Banned Pattern 3: AI-Generated Defaults

No generic gradient cards with centered text. No identical rounded rectangles in a perfect grid. No purple-to-blue gradients. No overuse of glassmorphism. No cookie-cutter hero sections. No Inter or Roboto as the typeface. No Tailwind defaults without customization. No identical spacing everywhere.

#### Banned Pattern 4: Urgency Mechanics

No countdown timers. No red flashing banners. No "last chance" messaging. No decaying progress bars. No FOMO-inducing visual patterns. The UI never pressures the player.

#### Banned Pattern 5: Pure Black or Pure White

No `#000000` anywhere. No `#FFFFFF` as a background. The darkest allowed color is `#1A1625` (Deep Indigo). The lightest allowed background is `#FFF8F0` (Cream). Everything lives in the warm spectrum.

#### Banned Pattern 6: Competing Focal Points

No screen may have two elements that compete for the same level of attention. If two elements are equally prominent, the layout fails. One element dominates. Everything else supports.

---

## 2. Visual Hierarchy

### 2.1 Primary Focus

The primary focus is always the pet. On every screen where the pet appears — which is most screens — the pet is the largest, most saturated, most animated element. It occupies the center-to-lower-center of the viewport, where a cat would naturally sit on a cushion.

The pet's sprite is rendered at the highest detail level in the entire application. It has the most colors, the most animation frames, and the most visual richness. Nothing else on the screen approaches this level of detail.

### 2.2 Secondary Focus

The secondary focus is the primary action available to the player. On the Home Hub, this is the "Scan" button. On the Scanner screen, this is the camera viewfinder. On the Collection screen, this is the grid of discovered products.

Secondary focus elements use:
- Honey (`#F5A623`) as their dominant color
- Larger size than surrounding elements (but smaller than the pet)
- Position near the bottom of the screen (thumb-reachable on mobile)
- Subtle animation to draw attention (gentle pulse, soft glow)

### 2.3 Tertiary Focus

Tertiary elements include navigation, stats, missions, and supplementary information. They exist at the edges of the screen — top for status, bottom for navigation, sides for supplementary panels on larger screens.

Tertiary elements use:
- Muted colors (lower saturation, lighter weight)
- Smaller sizes
- Reduced opacity or lighter text weight
- Minimal animation (only on state change)

### 2.4 Eye Movement

Every screen follows a predictable eye movement pattern:

**Home Hub**: Pet → Room atmosphere → Primary action (Scan) → HUD elements → Navigation
**Collection**: Featured item → Grid → Filter/Sort → Navigation
**Scanner**: Camera viewfinder → Pet in corner → Status indicators → Cancel button
**Profile**: Pet portrait → Name → Stats → Achievements → Navigation

The eye should always return to the pet. If the eye gets "stuck" on a UI element and does not naturally flow back to the companion, the hierarchy is wrong.

### 2.5 Reading Order

Information is consumed in this order:

1. **Visual** — The pet's appearance and behavior communicate state before any text
2. **Ambient** — Background color, lighting, and particles communicate atmosphere
3. **Iconic** — Small icons near the pet communicate specific stats (food bowl, heart, moon)
4. **Textual** — Labels, numbers, and descriptions are the last resort for communication

This order is intentional. The player should be able to understand their pet's state without reading a single word.

### 2.6 Attention Management

The design system uses a strict attention budget:

| Attention Level | Allowed Elements | Screen Percentage |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **High** | Pet, primary action | 40-60% of visual weight |
| **Medium** | Secondary information, cards | 20-30% of visual weight |
| **Low** | Navigation, stats, metadata | 10-20% of visual weight |
| **Ambient** | Background, particles, decorations | 5-10% of visual weight |

No screen may have more than one high-attention element (besides the pet). If a design requires two equally prominent elements, one must be reduced.

---

## 3. Layout System

### 3.1 Desktop Grid

**Container width**: 768px maximum content width, centered in the viewport.

**Column structure**: Single column by default. The pet's room occupies the full container width. Side panels are permitted only for supplementary information (statistics, collection previews) and are limited to 240px width.

**Layout composition**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Viewport                          │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │          Pet Room (full width)               │   │
│  │                                              │   │
│  │              [Pet Sprite]                    │   │
│  │                                              │   │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│  ┌────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────────────┐   │
│  │  Side Panel    │  │  Content Area            │   │
│  │  (optional)    │  │  (missions, collection)  │   │
│  │  240px max     │  │  fills remaining         │   │
│  └────────────────┘  └──────────────────────────┘   │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │          Bottom Navigation (desktop)         │   │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Side panel rules**:
- Side panels are optional, never mandatory
- When present, they appear on the right side
- Side panels use a subtle background color shift (Subtle cream `#FEF3E2`) to distinguish from the main content
- Side panels never contain primary actions
- Side panels collapse to a bottom section on tablet/mobile

### 3.2 Tablet Grid

**Container width**: 640px maximum content width, centered.

**Column structure**: Single column. The pet's room fills the full width. No side panels. Content stacks vertically below the pet room.

**Layout differences from desktop**:
- No side panels
- Navigation moves to bottom bar
- Cards arrange in 2-column grid where content naturally pairs
- Pet room height increases to use the wider aspect ratio

### 3.3 Mobile Grid

**Container width**: 100% viewport width with 16px edge margins.

**Column structure**: Single column, full-width stacking. The pet room fills the viewport. Content appears below, accessible via scroll.

**Layout composition**:

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│      Status Bar (OS)     │
├──────────────────────────┤
│   HUD (level, streak)    │
│                          │
│                          │
│      [Pet Sprite]        │
│                          │
│                          │
│   Primary Action (Scan)  │
│                          │
├──────────────────────────┤
│   Bottom Navigation      │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

**Mobile rules**:
- Bottom navigation is mandatory (thumb-reachable)
- Primary action button is bottom-center, above navigation
- HUD elements cluster at the top
- Pet occupies the middle 50-60% of the viewport
- No horizontal scrolling, ever
- Touch targets minimum 44×44px

### 3.4 Container Widths

| Context | Max Width | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Page content | 768px | Centered in viewport |
| Pet room | 768px (desktop), 100% (mobile) | Full available width |
| Cards | 400px max | Prevents cards from stretching too wide |
| Modals/Dialogs | 480px max | Centered, with warm overlay |
| Text content | 640px max | Optimal reading width (~65 chars) |
| Forms | 480px max | Centered, comfortable input width |
| Navigation (desktop) | 768px max | Aligned with content container |

### 3.5 Margins

| Context | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Page edge (mobile) | 16px | Comfortable thumb margin |
| Page edge (tablet) | 24px | More breathing room |
| Page edge (desktop) | 32px | Generous whitespace |
| Card internal | 24-32px | Generous internal breathing |
| Modal internal | 32-40px | Dialogs feel spacious |
| Section top/bottom | 48-64px | Major section separation |

### 3.6 Safe Areas

On devices with notches, rounded corners, or home indicators:

- **Top safe area**: Minimum 44px from top edge for HUD elements
- **Bottom safe area**: Minimum 34px from bottom edge for navigation
- **Side safe areas**: 16px minimum from any edge for interactive elements
- The pet sprite must never be clipped by a safe area boundary

### 3.7 Maximum Readable Width

Text content must never exceed 640px width. This ensures approximately 65 characters per line — the optimal reading width for comfortable comprehension.

Body text containers:
- Desktop: 640px max, centered
- Tablet: 560px max, centered
- Mobile: 100% minus 32px margins (edge padding)

### 3.8 Content Flow

Content flows vertically, like pages in a storybook:

1. **Hero area** — Pet room (always first, always dominant)
2. **Quick actions** — Primary and secondary actions (scan, feed, play)
3. **Status area** — Current missions, recent activity
4. **Collection preview** — Recent discoveries, progress
5. **Navigation** — Always reachable, always at the bottom

Horizontal flow is used only within card grids (collections, achievements) and never for primary navigation.

### 3.9 Whitespace Philosophy

Whitespace is not empty space. It is the room where the pet breathes.

**Whitespace rules**:

- The pet's immediate area: minimum 40-60px clear space on all sides
- Between major sections: 48-64px
- Between cards: 16-24px
- Inside cards: 24-32px padding
- Between text paragraphs: 16-24px
- Around primary action buttons: minimum 24px clear space

**The golden rule**: When in doubt, add more whitespace. A page that feels "too empty" is almost always better than a page that feels "too full." The player should feel the calm of an open room, not the pressure of a crowded one.

**Whitespace is proportional**: Larger elements get more whitespace around them. The pet (the largest element) gets the most. A tiny badge gets the least. This creates a natural rhythm that guides the eye.

---

## 4. Spacing System

### 4.1 The 4px Grid

Every spacing value in Scan Chan is a multiple of 4px. This creates a consistent visual rhythm that the player feels subconsciously as harmony.

No element may be positioned at a non-4px value. Margins, padding, gaps, offsets, and transforms all conform to the 4px grid.

**Exception**: 2px is permitted for tight internal gaps (icon-to-text spacing within a button) and for border widths.

### 4.2 Spacing Scale

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `space-0.5` | 2px | Tight internal gaps (icon-to-text within buttons), border widths |
| `space-1` | 4px | Minimum gap (badge padding, tight icon spacing) |
| `space-2` | 8px | Small gaps (between related items, badge padding) |
| `space-3` | 12px | Inline spacing (label to input, icon to label) |
| `space-4` | 16px | Default gap between related elements |
| `space-5` | 20px | Between related groups (card title to card body) |
| `space-6` | 24px | Card internal padding, between card grid items |
| `space-8` | 32px | Between sections, card padding (generous) |
| `space-10` | 40px | Between major sections |
| `space-12` | 48px | Page-level section breaks |
| `space-16` | 64px | Top/bottom page margins (desktop) |
| `space-20` | 80px | Hero section padding |
| `space-24` | 96px | Major page divisions |

### 4.3 Internal Spacing

Internal spacing (inside components) follows a tighter scale:

| Component | Internal Padding | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Button (large) | 16px vertical, 32px horizontal | Generous, pressable |
| Button (medium) | 12px vertical, 24px horizontal | Standard |
| Button (small) | 8px vertical, 16px horizontal | Compact |
| Card | 24-32px all sides | Spacious, warm |
| Input | 12-16px vertical, 16-20px horizontal | Comfortable |
| Badge | 4-8px vertical, 8-12px horizontal | Compact pill |
| Dialog | 32-40px all sides | Spacious, important |
| Toast | 12-16px vertical, 16-24px horizontal | Quick, compact |
| HUD element | 8-12px internal | Compact, ambient |
| Navigation item | 8-12px vertical, 12-16px horizontal | Tappable |

### 4.4 External Spacing

External spacing (between components) follows the full scale:

| Context | Spacing | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Between buttons in a group | 12px | Close enough to feel related |
| Between button and content | 24px | Clear separation |
| Between cards in a grid | 16-20px | Grid rhythm |
| Between card and section edge | 16px (mobile), 24px (desktop) | Edge breathing room |
| Between form fields | 16-20px | Scannable forms |
| Between list items | 8-12px | Compact list rhythm |
| Between navigation items | 8-16px | Tappable spacing |

### 4.5 Section Spacing

Sections are separated by generous whitespace:

| Section Type | Spacing | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Pet room to content below | 32-48px | Clear transition from pet to UI |
| Between major sections | 48-64px | Breathing room |
| Between subsections | 32-40px | Subtle grouping |
| Page top margin | 64-80px | Grand entrance |
| Page bottom margin | 80-96px | Comfortable end |

### 4.6 Component Spacing

Within a component, spacing creates rhythm:

| Component | Element Spacing | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Card with title + body | Title to body: 12px | Clear hierarchy |
| Card with image + text | Image to text: 16px | Visual separation |
| List item with icon + text | Icon to text: 12px | Related but distinct |
| Button with icon + label | Icon to label: 8px | Tight, unified |
| Badge with icon + text | Icon to text: 4px | Compact |
| Navigation with icon + label | Icon to label: 4px | Tight pair |

### 4.7 Visual Rhythm

Visual rhythm is created by alternating between dense and sparse areas:

```
[Sparse]  Pet room — large, open, breathing
[Dense]   Action buttons — clustered, tappable
[Sparse]  Section break — whitespace
[Dense]   Card grid — organized, scannable
[Sparse]  Section break — whitespace
[Dense]   Mission list — organized items
[Sparse]  Page end — generous bottom margin
```

This alternation prevents the page from feeling monotonous (all sparse) or overwhelming (all dense). The eye rests in sparse areas and engages in dense areas.

---

## 5. Radius System

### 5.1 Corner Radius Scale

Everything in Scan Chan is rounded. This is non-negotiable. The world of Scan Chan has no sharp edges.

The radius scale is proportional: larger containers receive larger radii. This creates a natural softness that feels organic rather than geometric.

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `radius-sm` | 12px | Small elements: badges, small buttons, tooltips |
| `radius-md` | 16px | Medium elements: inputs, small cards, images |
| `radius-lg` | 24px | Large elements: standard cards, panels |
| `radius-xl` | 32px | Extra-large elements: modals, dialogs, large panels |
| `radius-2xl` | 40px | Maximum containers: full-width section backgrounds |
| `radius-full` | 999px | Pill shapes: buttons, progress bars, tab containers, badges |
| `radius-circle` | 50% | Circles: avatars, icon buttons, level indicators |

### 5.2 Button Radius

All buttons use `radius-full` (999px). This creates the pill shape that is a signature element of the Scan Chan interface.

No button may ever have a radius below 999px. This includes icon buttons (which are circles, using `radius-circle`), primary buttons, secondary buttons, and ghost buttons.

### 5.3 Card Radius

| Card Type | Radius | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Standard card | 24px | Default, generous softness |
| Interactive card | 24px | Same as standard |
| Pet card | 32px | Extra softness for the companion |
| Achievement card | 24px | Consistent with standard |
| Mission card | 24px | Consistent with standard |
| Product card | 20px | Slightly tighter for grid density |
| Stat card | 20px | Compact but soft |

### 5.4 Dialog Radius

| Dialog Type | Radius | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Standard modal | 32px | Spacious, important |
| Confirmation dialog | 32px | Consistent with modal |
| Bottom sheet | 32px top corners only | Rounded top, flat bottom |
| Reward popup | 32px | Celebratory, soft |
| Evolution popup | 40px | Extra-large for the most special moment |

### 5.5 Popup Radius

| Popup Type | Radius | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Toast notification | 16px | Compact, quick |
| XP popup | 999px (pill) | Floating near pet |
| Dropdown menu | 20px | Soft, approachable |
| Tooltip | 12px | Small, unobtrusive |
| Context menu | 20px | Consistent with dropdown |

### 5.6 Avatar Radius

All avatars are circles (`radius-circle`, 50%). This applies to:
- Pet portraits
- Player avatars
- Friend avatars (future)
- Any circular image representation

### 5.7 Image Radius

| Image Type | Radius | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Product image | 16px | Consistent with card content |
| Achievement image | 50% (circle) | Badge-like |
| Room screenshot | 24px | Matches card radius |
| Banner image | 24px | Matches section containers |
| Thumbnail | 12px | Small but soft |

### 5.8 Pet Canvas Radius

The pet's display area uses one of two treatments:

1. **No visible container** (preferred) — The pet sits directly on the room background. No border, no radius, no visible container. The pet's world IS the screen.
2. **Soft vignette** (alternative) — A very large radius (40-48px) with a subtle inner shadow creates a soft frame, like looking through a rounded window.

The pet canvas must never have a visible hard border. If a container is needed, it must blend into the background through color matching and soft shadows.

---

## 6. Elevation System

### 6.1 Shadow Language

Shadows in Scan Chan communicate depth and importance. They are always warm-toned — never gray, never blue, never black. Every shadow uses a warm brown base (`#2D2620`) at low opacity.

Shadows serve three purposes:

1. **Depth** — Communicating which elements are closer to the viewer
2. **Importance** — Elevating elements that need attention
3. **Separation** — Distinguishing overlapping layers without harsh borders

### 6.2 Shadow Levels

| Level | Name | CSS Value | Usage |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| 0 | None | No shadow | Background elements, flat surfaces |
| 1 | Subtle | `0 2px 8px rgba(45,38,32,0.06)` | Cards at rest, subtle separation |
| 2 | Low | `0 4px 12px rgba(45,38,32,0.08)` | Interactive cards, slightly elevated |
| 3 | Medium | `0 8px 24px rgba(45,38,32,0.10)` | Buttons, floating elements |
| 4 | High | `0 12px 32px rgba(45,38,32,0.12)` | Modals, dialogs, popups |
| 5 | Highest | `0 20px 48px rgba(45,38,32,0.16)` | Full-screen overlays, evolution popup |

**Shadow rules**:
- Shadows always point downward (light source is upper-left)
- Shadow color is always warm brown, never gray or black
- Shadow opacity never exceeds 0.16 (16%)
- Shadow blur is always generous (minimum 8px)
- No element may have a hard shadow (0 blur)

### 6.3 Border Usage

Borders are used sparingly in Scan Chan. The design system prefers elevation (shadows) and background color shifts to communicate separation.

**When borders are allowed**:
- Input fields (2px warm gray, transitions to Honey on focus)
- Secondary/ghost buttons (2px border as their primary visual)
- Cards that need subtle definition (1px warm white at low opacity)
- Status badges (thin semantic-colored border)

**When borders are banned**:
- Primary buttons (use fill color, not border)
- Panels (use background color shift)
- Between sections (use whitespace)
- Around the pet (never frame the pet with a border)

**Border color rules**:
- Default border: Warm gray `rgba(45,38,32,0.12)`
- Focus border: Honey `#F5A623`
- Active border: Honey Dark `#C4841D`
- Error border: Coral `#FB923C` or Muted Red `#F87171`
- Never use pure gray borders (`#CCCCCC`, `#E0E0E0`)

### 6.4 Floating Hierarchy

The z-axis hierarchy of the application:

| Z-Level | Layer | Elements |
|---------|-------|----------|
| 0 | Background | Room walls, window, ambient decorations |
| 1 | Environment | Furniture, objects, plants |
| 2 | Pet | Scan Chan (always prominent, never obscured) |
| 3 | Foreground UI | HUD elements, navigation, action buttons |
| 4 | Overlays | Modals, popups, toasts, bottom sheets |
| 5 | System | Loading spinners, system notifications |

**Layer rules**:
- The pet is always on layer 2 and is never obscured by layer 3
- HUD elements float above but never cover the pet's face or body
- Modals dim everything below layer 4 with a warm overlay
- Toast notifications appear at layer 5 but are compact and auto-dismiss

### 6.5 Glass Usage

Glassmorphism (frosted glass effect) is used with extreme restraint. It is permitted only in these contexts:

- **Bottom navigation bar** (mobile): Subtle backdrop blur to separate navigation from scrolling content
- **Scanner overlay**: Frosted glass around the viewfinder area
- **Toast notifications**: Subtle glass background for readability over any content

**Glass rules**:
- Blur radius: 12-20px
- Background: Warm white at 60-80% opacity (never pure white)
- Border: 1px warm white at 20% opacity (optional)
- Shadow: Level 1 or 2 warm shadow
- Never use cool-tinted glass (no blue, no purple tint)
- Glass must always have a warm color cast

### 6.6 Blur Usage

Blur is used for depth and focus:

| Context | Blur Amount | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Modal backdrop | 8-12px | Focus attention on dialog |
| Background elements (depth) | 2-4px | Create depth-of-field effect |
| Bottom navigation backdrop | 12-16px | Separate nav from content |
| Scanner non-focus area | 4-8px | Direct attention to viewfinder |
| Toast backdrop | 8-12px | Readability over content |

**Blur rules**:
- Blur is always a warm blur (never cool or neutral)
- Blur must never obscure the pet
- Reduced-motion preference: Replace blur transitions with simple opacity fades

### 6.7 Lighting Interaction

The UI responds to the time-of-day lighting system defined in the Brand Book:

| Time | Shadow Adjustment | Color Cast |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| Morning (6-10 AM) | Longer, softer shadows | Warm gold tint |
| Midday (10 AM-2 PM) | Shorter, brighter shadows | Neutral warmth |
| Afternoon (2-6 PM) | Medium shadows, warm | Amber warmth |
| Evening (6-9 PM) | Longer, deeper shadows | Deep amber |
| Night (9 PM-6 AM) | Very soft, diffused | Cool lavender with warm lamp glow |

Shadows shift subtly with the lighting. In morning, shadows are longer and more visible. At night, shadows are softer and more diffused. This creates a living, breathing interface that feels connected to the real world.

## 7. Color Application

### 7.1 Where Every Color Is Allowed

- **One primary action per screen maximum**

- Shadow: Level 3 warm shadow

### 7.3 Secondary Actions

Secondary actions use transparent fills with Honey or Rose borders:

- Fill: Transparent
- Border: 2px Honey (`#F5A623`) or Rose (`#F472B6`)
- Text: Same color as border
- No shadow at rest
- Hover: Light fill (10% opacity of border color)

- Fill: Original color at 30% opacity
- Text: Original color at 40% opacity
- Border: Original color at 20% opacity
- Cursor: not-allowed
- No hover/active states

### 7.8 Hover

Hover states brighten the element slightly:

- Primary buttons: Brightness +10%, subtle scale (1.02)
- Secondary buttons: Light fill appears (10% opacity)
- Cards: Slight lift (translateY -2px), shadow increases to Level 2
- Links: Color transitions to Honey
- Icons: Subtle scale (1.1)
- Duration: 100-150ms ease-out

### 7.9 Pressed

Pressed states create a satisfying "give":

- Secondary buttons: Fill increases to 20% opacity
- Cards: Slight press (translateY +1px), shadow decreases
- Interactive elements: Quick scale (0.97), 80ms ease-in
- Duration: 80-100ms ease-in

### 7.10 Selected

Selected states use Honey as the indicator:

- Selected background: Honey at 10% opacity
- Selected border: 2px Honey
- Selected text: Honey Dark or primary text color
- Selected icon: Honey fill
- A subtle left border (4px Honey) can indicate selected items in lists

### 7.11 Focus

Focus states are visible, warm, and never clinical:

- Focus glow: Soft Honey outer glow at 20% opacity
- Never use blue focus rings (browser defaults)
- Focus states must be visible in both light and dark modes

### 7.12 Background Hierarchy

Backgrounds create depth through subtle color shifts:

| Layer | Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-------|-----|-------|
| Base | Cream | `#FFF8F0` | Page background, never pure white |
| Surface | Warm White | `#FFFDF9` | Cards, elevated areas |
| Subtle | Subtle Cream | `#FEF3E2` | Alternate sections, gentle separation |
| Deep | Warm Beige | `#F5ECD7` | Deeper recessed areas |
| Overlay | Warm dark | `rgba(45,38,32,0.40)` | Modal backdrops |
| Mesh | Gradient blend | Multi-point radial | Organic backgrounds at 30-40% opacity |

**Background rules**:
- The base background is always Cream, never pure white
- Cards sit on Warm White to create subtle elevation
- Alternate sections use Subtle Cream for gentle separation
- Mesh gradients add organic warmth but are used sparingly (hero areas, landing pages)
- Background color shifts subtly with the pet's emotional state (max 10-15% adjustment)

## 9. Iconography System

### 9.1 Icon Sizes

| `icon-xl` | 48px | Achievement badges, special moments |
| `icon-2xl` | 64px | Hero illustrations, empty states |

### 9.2 Stroke Weight

Icons use one of two styles, chosen once and applied consistently:

**Style A — Rounded Stroke** (preferred):
- Stroke width: 2px at 24px base
- Line cap: Round
- Line join: Round
- Fill: None (outline only)
- Color: Warm brown (`#2D2620`) or muted brown

**Style B — Pixel Art** (for game-specific icons):
- Grid: 16×16 or 32×32
- Style: Consistent with pet sprite pixel art
- Outline: Dark warm brown (`#2D2620`)
- Fill: Semantic colors where appropriate

**Icon style rules**:
- Choose one style and stay consistent across the entire application
- Navigation icons, action icons, and status icons use the same style
- Pixel-art icons are reserved for game-specific elements (food, toys, furniture)
- Never mix stroke icons and pixel icons in the same context

### 9.3 Filled vs Outline

| Context | Style | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Navigation (inactive) | Outline | Light, unobtrusive |
| Navigation (active) | Filled | Clear active state |
| Action buttons | Outline with fill on hover | Interactive affordance |
| Status indicators | Filled | Communicates state clearly |
| Stat icons | Filled with semantic color | Communicates stat identity |
| Decorative | Outline | Light, ambient |

### 9.4 Pixel Icons

Pixel-art icons are used for game-specific elements:

| Category | Grid Size | Examples |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Food items | 16×16 | Fish, milk, cookie, apple |
| Toys | 16×16 | Yarn ball, mouse toy, feather |
| Furniture | 32×32 | Cat bed, shelf, lamp, window |
| Stats | 16×16 | Bowl (hunger), heart (affection), moon (energy), star (mood), magnifier (curiosity) |
| Achievements | 32×32 | Trophy, star, badge, milestone |

**Pixel icon rules**:
- Must be readable at 16×16 display size
- Use the same warm brown outline as the pet sprite
- 2-3 shades per color area (base, shadow, highlight)
- No anti-aliasing
- `image-rendering: pixelated` for crisp display at all sizes

### 9.5 Emoji Usage

Emoji are used with extreme restraint:

**Allowed**:
- In pet thought/speech bubbles (cat-appropriate expressions)
- In memory/achievement descriptions (to add warmth)
- In toast messages (to add personality, maximum 1 emoji)

**Banned**:
- As section headers or navigation icons
- Scattered as decoration without purpose
- In large quantities on any single screen
- As replacements for proper icon design
- In button labels

### 9.6 Illustration Icons

For empty states, onboarding, and special moments, larger illustration-style icons are used:

- Size: 64-128px
- Style: Pixel art, consistent with pet sprite quality
- Palette: Limited (4-6 colors from the main palette)
- Detail: Medium — recognizable but not intricate
- Examples: Empty box, sleeping cat, magnifying glass, trophy shelf

### 9.7 Navigation Icons

Navigation icons must be immediately recognizable:

| Home | House or paw print | Rounded stroke or pixel |
| Scanner | Camera or barcode | Rounded stroke |
| Collection | Book or scrapbook | Rounded stroke or pixel |

|------|------|-------|
| Hunger | Food bowl | Honey `#F5A623` |
| Mood | Star or smile | Rose `#F472B6` |
| Energy | Moon or lightning | Sky `#67E8F9` |
| Affection | Heart | Rose `#F472B6` |
| Curiosity | Magnifying glass | Sage `#86EFAC` |

**Status icon rules**:

## 18. Motion System

### 18.1 Duration

| Category | Duration | Usage |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Instant | 80-100ms | Button press, toggle, quick color changes |
| Micro | 100-150ms | Hover, focus, small state changes |
| Small | 150-250ms | Button release, toggle animation, badge appear |
| Medium | 250-400ms | Card open, panel slide, dropdown |
| Large | 400-600ms | Page transitions, modal appear, sheet slide |
| Celebratory | 600-1500ms | Evolution, achievement, level up |

**Duration rules**:
- Nothing animates faster than 80ms (imperceptible)
- Nothing animates slower than 1500ms (feels broken)
- Interactive feedback (hover, click) must respond within 150ms
- Pet idle animations run on longer cycles (3-6 seconds)

### 18.2 Easing

| Animation Type | Easing | Character |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| Enter / Appear | `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` | Smooth, confident arrival |
| Exit / Disappear | `ease-in` | Quick departure |
| Bounce | `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` | Playful overshoot |
| Hover | `ease-out` | Quick, responsive |
| Press | `ease-in` | Quick compression |
| Float | `ease-in-out` | Gentle, continuous |
| Spring | Custom spring physics | Organic, natural settling |

**Easing rules**:
- Never use `linear` for UI animations (feels robotic)
- Never use `ease` (generic) — always use a specific curve
- Bounce easing is used sparingly — for celebrations and interactive elements, not for layout shifts
- Page transitions use the smooth enter curve

### 18.3 Spring Physics

For organic, natural-feeling animations:

**Standard spring**:
- Stiffness: 200
- Damping: 20
- Mass: 1
- Usage: Card interactions, button releases, popup appearances

**Gentle spring**:
- Stiffness: 120
- Damping: 18
- Mass: 1
- Usage: Pet movements, idle animations, ambient elements

**Bouncy spring**:
- Stiffness: 300
- Damping: 12
- Mass: 1
- Usage: Celebrations, reward popups, level-up moments

## 20. Accessibility Rules

### 20.1 Contrast

| Element | Minimum Contrast Ratio | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|-------|
| Body text on background | 4.5:1 | WCAG AA |
| Heading text on background | 4.5:1 | WCAG AA |
| Large text (18px+) on background | 3:1 | WCAG AA Large |
| Interactive element borders | 3:1 | Visible affordance |
| Icon on background | 3:1 | Recognizable |
| Text on buttons | 4.5:1 | Readable at all sizes |
| Muted/secondary text | 4.5:1 | Still readable |

**Contrast notes**:
- The warm cream background provides natural high contrast with dark brown text
- Semantic colors on light backgrounds must be individually checked
- Never use low-contrast text for important information
- Dark mode contrast ratios follow the same minimums

### 20.2 Touch Targets

| Element | Minimum Size | Preferred Size |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Buttons | 44×44px | 48×48px+ |
| Navigation items | 44×44px | 48×48px |
| Icon buttons | 40×40px | 44×44px |
| Links | 44px height minimum | — |
| Checkboxes | 44×44px (touch area) | — |
| Switches | 44px height minimum | — |
| Pet tap area | Larger than visible sprite | 20% larger |

**Touch target rules**:
- Minimum spacing between touch targets: 8px
- Pet tap area is forgiving — feels like petting, not clicking
- All interactive elements are reachable with one thumb on mobile
- FAB is positioned in the thumb zone (bottom-center)

### 20.3 Keyboard Navigation

All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible:

- **Tab order**: Follows visual layout (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
- **Focus indicator**: 2px Honey ring with 4px offset (visible on all backgrounds)
- **Enter/Space**: Activates buttons, toggles, links
- **Escape**: Closes modals, dropdowns, sheets
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate within tab bars, dropdowns, radio groups
- **Skip navigation**: "Skip to content" link available on first tab press

### 20.4 Reduced Motion

All animations honor `prefers-reduced-motion`:

| Animation Type | Full Motion | Reduced Motion |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| Page transitions | Fade + slide | Instant or fade only |
| Hover effects | Lift + shadow | Color change only |
| Pet idle | Breathing, blinking, tail | Static or minimal breathing |
| Particles | Floating, bursting | Static icons or disabled |
| Evolution | Full sequence | Static before/after with text |
| Level up | Particle burst | Badge update only |
| Popups | Scale + bounce | Fade only |
| Loading | Spinner | Static indicator |

**Reduced motion rules**:
- The game is fully functional and enjoyable with all motion disabled
- Information is never communicated only through animation
- Pet idle animations retain a subtle breathing cycle if any motion is kept

### 20.5 Readable Typography

- Minimum body text: 16px
- Minimum contrast: 4.5:1
- Maximum line length: 65 characters (desktop)
- Line height: 1.5x font size minimum for body text
- Never all-caps for more than 3 consecutive words
- Text on colored backgrounds must pass contrast checks
- Text over images requires a backdrop

### 20.6 Screen Reader Considerations

- All interactive elements have descriptive `aria-labels`
- Pet state changes are announced via `aria-live` regions
- Images have meaningful `alt` text (not "image" or "icon")
- Form errors are announced when they appear
- Modal open/close traps and releases focus correctly
- Navigation landmarks are used (`nav`, `main`, `aside`)
- Color is never the sole communicator of information

## 25. Home Hub Blueprint

This is the most important section in the UI Production Guide. The Home Hub is where the player spends the majority of their time. It must be designed with extreme care.

### 25.1 Screen Composition

The Home Hub is a single, unified screen where the pet is always the visual center.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Level Badge]              [Streak]     │ ← HUD (top, ambient)

### 25.2 Proportions

| Zone | Screen Percentage | Content |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| HUD zone (top) | 10-15% | Level badge, pet name, streak counter |
| Pet zone (center) | 50-60% | Pet sprite, room environment, ambient particles |
| Action zone (lower) | 15-20% | Primary action (Scan FAB), secondary actions |
| Navigation zone (bottom) | 10-12% | Bottom navigation bar |

The pet zone must always be the largest zone. If HUD or navigation grows, the pet zone shrinks last.

### 25.3 Spacing

- Top padding (below status bar): 44-56px
- Pet sprite clear space: 40-60px on all sides
- Between HUD elements: 16px
- Between primary action and bottom nav: 16-20px
- Bottom nav height: 64-72px
- Bottom safe area: 34px

### 25.4 Hierarchy

Visual hierarchy of the Home Hub:

1. **Pet sprite** — largest, most detailed, most animated element
2. **Room environment** — atmospheric background that frames the pet
3. **Scan FAB** — the primary action, Honey-colored, bottom-center
4. **Level badge + pet name** — ambient information, top area
5. **Bottom navigation** — always reachable, never dominant
6. **Mission tracker** — compact, bottom-left, expandable on tap
7. **Ambient particles** — dust motes, light effects, atmosphere

### 25.5 HUD Placement

| Element | Position | Behavior |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Level badge | Top-left, 44px from top | Always visible, tappable for XP detail |
| Pet name | Below level badge | Always visible |
| Streak counter | Top-right | Compact (icon + number) |
| Coins (future) | Top-right, below streak | Compact pill |
| Mission tracker | Bottom-left, above nav | Collapsed by default |
| Stat indicators | Near pet (optional) | Ambient icons, fade after 5s |

**HUD rules**:
- HUD elements must never exceed 15% of screen real estate
- HUD fades to 50% opacity after 5s of inactivity
- HUD returns to full opacity on tap/hover
- Pet name and level badge are always subtly visible

### 25.6 Interaction Flow

**Opening the app**:
1. Screen loads with warmth (soft colors, gentle light) — 500ms
2. Pet is wherever it was when the player last left — instant
3. Pet notices the player (ears perk, looks up) — 500ms
4. Pet greets based on absence duration — 1000ms
5. HUD elements fade in — 300ms
6. Home Hub is ready for interaction

**Scanning a product**:
1. Player taps Scan FAB
2. Scanner transition plays (see section 15)
3. Product is scanned
4. Return to Home Hub with feeding sequence (see section 15.8)
5. XP popup, mission update, collection update happen in sequence

**Tapping the pet**:
1. Pet reacts to touch (purr, lean, happy expression) — 500ms
2. Affection particles (hearts) — 800ms
3. Small affection indicator appears briefly — 1500ms

**Checking missions**:
1. Player taps mission tracker
2. Tracker expands with smooth animation — 300ms
3. Active missions visible with progress
4. Tap outside to collapse

### 25.7 Camera Framing

The "camera" of the Home Hub frames the pet like a photograph:

- **Rule of thirds**: Pet sits at the intersection of the lower-third and center
- **Headroom**: Generous space above the pet (the "ceiling" of the room)
- **Ground**: The pet sits on a visible surface (floor, cushion, shelf)
- **Background**: Room walls, window, decorations create depth
- **Lighting**: Upper-left warm light source (consistent with pixel art shading)

### 25.8 Idle State

When the player is not interacting, the Home Hub is alive:

- Pet: Continuous idle animations (breathing, blinking, tail swish, ear twitch)
- Background: Ambient particles (dust motes in light beams)
- Lighting: Shifts subtly with time of day
- Furniture: Subtle idle animations (swinging plant, flickering lamp)
- Window: Light changes, occasional cloud shadow
- HUD: Faded to 50%, unobtrusive

### 25.9 Feeding Sequence

The feeding sequence is the emotional core of the Home Hub:

1. **Product appears** — Small pixel-art icon appears near the pet (300ms)
2. **Pet notices** — Ears perk, head turns toward product (300ms)
3. **Pet approaches** — Walks toward product cautiously (500ms)
4. **Pet sniffs** — Leans in, sniffs product (300ms)
5. **Pet eats** — Eating animation, satisfied expression (500ms)
6. **Pet reacts** — Happy bounce, hearts/sparkles float up (800ms)
7. **XP gain** — "+XX XP" floats up toward level badge (1500ms)
8. **Stat update** — Hunger/mood bars fill subtly (500ms)
9. **Pet settles** — Returns to idle position, content expression (500ms)

Total duration: ~5 seconds. The sequence is never rushed. It should feel like watching a real cat encounter food.

### 25.10 Evolution Presentation

When the pet reaches an evolution threshold:

1. **Anticipation** — Pet glows subtly, ambient particles intensify (1000ms)
2. **Screen dims** — Room darkens, warm golden light focuses on pet (500ms)
3. **Transformation** — Pet silhouette grows and changes shape (1500ms)
4. **Reveal** — Light burst, new form visible, sparkle shower (1000ms)
5. **Recognition** — "Your companion has grown" text fades in (500ms)
6. **New form** — Player sees the evolved pet in full detail (2000ms)
7. **Continue** — Single button to return to normal view
8. **Return** — Screen brightens, room returns, pet settles into new form (500ms)

Total duration: ~7 seconds. This is the most emotionally significant moment in Scan Chan. Every pixel, every particle, every sound must be perfect.

## 26. Component Checklist

Every UI component must pass this checklist before implementation. If a component fails more than two checks, it must be redesigned.

Sprint 2.8 establishes the reusable UI Component Foundation before Home Hub, scanner UI, inventory UI, navigation, or mascot rendering are implemented. The foundation includes app shell, responsive/safe-area containers, layout primitives, surfaces, panels, typography primitives, button and icon-button usage, badges, progress bars, status chips, stat cards, empty/loading states, toast container, dialog foundation, bottom sheet foundation, and accessibility helpers.

Sprint 2.8 components are presentational only. They may accept typed ViewModel data or primitive props, but they must not read stores, call services, access repositories, access Prisma, implement routes, run scanner camera logic, render mascot assets, or own gameplay rules.

Sprint 2.9 composes the first Home Hub screen from the established primitives. The pet/mascot placeholder remains the dominant visual zone, secondary panels stay supportive, and all status, recommendation, and daily-summary sections consume the Home Hub ViewModel instead of owning gameplay logic. The placeholder may expose renderer attachment points, but it must not render mascot assets or implement animation.

Sprint 3.5 establishes the v2 Scanner UI Foundation. The scanner surface should feel like a warm camera room, not a utility dashboard: the preview area is dominant, scan guides are simple and readable, secondary controls stay compact, permission/error/loading/unavailable states stay calm, and success/failure states remain placeholders until scanner gameplay is connected. The screen must not own product lookup, feeding, rewards, pet updates, or final scan animation behavior.

### Visual Checks

- [ ] **Is it rounded?** — No sharp corners. Radius proportional to size.
- [ ] **Is it warm?** — Colors are in the warm spectrum. No cool grays, no pure black, no pure white.
- [ ] **Is it consistent?** — Uses the same spacing, radius, shadow, and typography as other components.
- [ ] **Does it breathe?** — Generous whitespace around and within. Not cramped.
- [ ] **Is the hierarchy clear?** — One dominant element, clear secondary, muted tertiary.

### Interaction Checks

- [ ] **Is it tappable?** — Touch target minimum 44×44px.
- [ ] **Does it respond?** — Hover, press, focus states are defined and feel good.
- [ ] **Does it animate?** — Transitions use the correct easing and duration.
- [ ] **Is it accessible?** — Contrast ratios pass. Keyboard navigation works. Screen reader labels exist.
- [ ] **Does it honor reduced motion?** — Alternative to animation is defined.

### Philosophy Checks

- [ ] **Does it serve the pet?** — The component exists to support the companion experience.
- [ ] **Is it ambient?** — Information is felt, not read. The component does not shout.
- [ ] **Is it necessary?** — Removing it would reduce the experience. It earns its place.
- [ ] **Does it feel cozy?** — Looking at it creates a warm, calm feeling.
- [ ] **Would it pass the storybook test?** — It looks like it belongs in a handcrafted storybook, not a dashboard.

### Brand Checks

- [ ] **Does it match the Brand Book?** — Colors, typography, voice, and personality are consistent.
- [ ] **Does it match the Visual Design Document?** — Shape language, depth, composition rules are followed.
- [ ] **Does it avoid banned patterns?** — No dashboard layouts, no SaaS aesthetics, no AI-slop defaults.
- [ ] **Is the microcopy warm?** — Labels, messages, and tooltips use the brand voice.
- [ ] **Does it feel like Scan Chan?** — If you covered the logo, would someone still recognize this as Scan Chan?

### Technical Checks

- [ ] **Is it on the 4px grid?** — All spacing values are multiples of 4.
- [ ] **Is it responsive?** — Defined for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- [ ] **Is dark mode defined?** — Colors, shadows, and backgrounds have dark mode values.
- [ ] **Are all states designed?** — Default, hover, pressed, focus, disabled, loading, error, success.
- [ ] **Is it implementable?** — A developer can build it from this specification without guessing.

## 27. Design System Evolution

### 27.1 What May Evolve

These elements may change over the next 5-10 years as the product grows:

| Element | How It May Evolve | Constraint |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| Component library | New components added as features expand | Must follow existing spacing, radius, shadow, and color rules |
| Typography scale | Additional sizes added for new contexts | Must maintain Fredoka + Nunito pairing, warm proportions |
| Color palette | New semantic colors added for new stats or features | Must be warm-toned, must have defined usage and forbidden zones |
| Iconography | New icons designed for new features | Must follow existing style (rounded stroke or pixel art) |
| Animation vocabulary | New animations for new interactions | Must use defined easing curves, duration ranges, and particle rules |
| Layout patterns | New layouts for new screens (mini-games, social features) | Must follow single-column-first philosophy, pet-centric hierarchy |
| Dark mode | Deeper nighttime atmosphere, seasonal dark mode variations | Must maintain warm undertones, never pure black |
| Responsive rules | New breakpoints for new devices (foldables, AR glasses) | Must maintain pet-centric composition at every size |
| Seasonal themes | Color shifts, decorations, environmental changes per season | Must be subtle (10-15% palette adjustment), must not overwhelm the pet |
| Material language | New surfaces and textures for expanded environments | Must follow warm material rules (paper, wood, ceramic, felt — never glass, metal, glossy plastic) |
| Merchandise UI | App-to-physical design translation for merchandise | Must follow Brand Book merchandise philosophy |

### 27.2 What Must Never Change

These elements are the DNA of the Scan Chan design system and cannot be altered:

1. **The pet is always the visual center** — No matter how many features are added, the pet dominates every screen
2. **Warmth is the default temperature** — Cool palettes exist only for night mode or contrast
3. **Everything is rounded** — Sharp corners are permanently banned
4. **Information is ambient** — Stats whisper, they never shout
5. **The interface disappears behind the pet** — UI is the frame, not the painting
6. **Honey is the signature color** — The warm golden tone defines the brand
7. **Fredoka + Nunito are the voices** — Typography identity is permanent
8. **Motion is gentle** — Nothing snaps, jolts, or startles
9. **The 4px grid is the foundation** — All spacing derives from this grid
10. **The emotional contract is sacred** — No UI pattern may create guilt, urgency, or anxiety
11. **Dark mode is nighttime, not inverted** — It creates atmosphere, not contrast

### 27.3 The Ten-Year Test

Before making any design system change, ask:

> "Will this decision still feel right in ten years?"

If the answer is yes, proceed. If the answer is "it follows a current trend," reconsider. The design system must age gracefully — like a well-loved storybook, not like a tech startup's landing page.

### 27.4 Versioning

The design system is versioned:

- **Major versions** (2.0, 3.0): Structural changes — new layout philosophy, new component paradigm, new platform support
- **Minor versions** (1.1, 1.2): Additive changes — new components, new icons, new animation patterns
- **Patch versions** (1.0.1, 1.0.2): Corrections — spacing fixes, color adjustments, state clarifications

Every change is documented in CHANGELOG.md and reflected in this guide before implementation begins.

### 27.5 The Evolution Philosophy

The design system evolves like Scan Chan itself — slowly, warmly, with intention. It does not chase trends. It does not redesign for the sake of novelty. It grows richer, deeper, and more refined over time, while its core identity remains unchanged.

A player who opens Scan Chan in ten years should feel the same warmth they felt on day one — even if every component has been rebuilt, every animation refined, and every layout reimagined. The feeling is the constant. The system serves the feeling.

**Document Status**: This is the active Design System Bible for Scan Chan. All UI components, layouts, interactions, and compositions must conform to this document. When UI production decisions are made during development, this document must be updated before implementation is considered complete.
